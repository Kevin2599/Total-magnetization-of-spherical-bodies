# Estimation of the total magnetization direction of approximately spherical bodies

We present a new method for estimating the total magnetization direction
of uniformly magnetized bodies from the observed total field anomaly. By 
considering magnetic sources with approximately spherical shapes and known
centre, we formulate an inverse problem for estimating the total 
magnetization vector of all spheres.
