We have developed a fast total-field anomaly inversion to estimate the 
magnetization direction of multiple sources with approximately spherical 
shape and known centres. Our method can be applied to interpret multiple 
sources with different magnetization directions. It neither requires the 
prior computation of any transformation like reduction to the pole nor the 
use of regularly spaced data on a horizontal grid. The method contains 
flexibility to be implemented as a linear or non-linear inverse problem, 
which results, respectively, in a least-squares or robust estimates of the 
components of the magnetization vector of the sources. Applications to 
synthetic data show the robustness of our method against interfering 
anomalies and errors in the location of the sources' centre. Besides, we 
show the feasibility of applying the upward continuation to interpret 
non-spherical sources. Applications to field data over the Goi치s Alkaline 
Province (GAP), Brazil, show the good performance of our method in estimating 
geological meaningful magnetization directions. The results obtained for a 
region of the GAP, near from the alkaline complex of Diorama, suggest the 
presence of non-outcropping sources marked by strong remanent magnetization 
with inclination and declination close to -70.35<sup>o</sup> and -19.81<sup>o</sup>, 
respectively. This estimated magnetization direction leads to predominantly positive 
reduced-to-the-pole anomalies, even for other region of the GAP, in the 
alkaline complex of Montes Claros de Goi치s. These results show that the 
non-outcropping sources near from the alkaline complex of Diorama have almost 
the same magnetization direction of that ones in the alkaline complex of 
Montes Claros de Goi치s, strongly suggesting that these sources have emplaced 
the crust almost within the same geological time interval.
