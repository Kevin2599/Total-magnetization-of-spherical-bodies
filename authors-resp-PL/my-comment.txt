\noindent{\bf General comments}

\bigskip

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "The forward problem described 
is essentially identical to a mesh-based discretization but with 
the space-filling mesh cells (prisms, tetrahedra, etc) replaced 
with spherical (dipole) sources. Hence, the methods presented are 
essentially identical to those used by Lelievre and Oldenburg (2009) 
and Ellis et al. (2012)."}

\bigskip

We fully disagree with your comment that the forward problem in 
our method is \textcolor{red}{essentially identical} to the one 
adopted by Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009). 


The interpretation model 
adopted by Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009) consists of an 
$m_{x} \times m_{y} \times m_{z}$ grid of 3D juxtaposed prisms in 
the horizontal and vertical directions. 
Hence, in the 
Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009) the associated forward model 
(their equation 10) requires computing the $N$ by $3M$ full 
sensitivity matrix being $N$ the number of data and $M$ the number 
of prisms of the interpretation model. A large data set combined 
with the discretization of the Earth’s subsurface into a fine grid 
of prisms results in a large-scale 3D forward model. Notice that 
in our method we {\bf do not} discretize the earth’s subsurface into an 
$m_{x} \times m_{y} \times m_{z}$ grid of 3D juxtaposed dipoles in 
the horizontal and vertical directions.  Hence, our interpretation 
model does not consist of a 3D, equally spaced array of dipoles.
Rather, the forward problem adopted by our method consists of a 
set of $L$ dipoles (Figure 1 of our manuscript). Hence, in our method 
the associated forward model (our equation 16) requires computing 
the $N$ by $3L$ sensitivity matrix where $L <<<<< M$. Thus, our method 
deals with a small-scale forward model being completely different 
from the one adopted by Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009).

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "The difference is that where Lelièvre, 
Ellis et al. develop methods to solve an underdetermined inverse problem (many 
more mesh cells than data observations), the authors of this manuscript only 
consider the solution of a simpler overdetermined problem (far fewer source 
parameters than data observations)."}

\bigskip

We agree that Lelièvre and Oldenburg’s (2009) method solves an 
underdetermined inverse problem while our method solves an 
overdetermined problem. However, this characteristic is not the 
unique difference between these approaches. Figure 1 
presents a list of the characteristics found in Lelièvre and 
Oldenburg’ (2009) method in comparison with those found in our 
method in this manuscript. By analyzing the Figure 1, we can 
easily conclude that these methods are substantially different. 
We highlighted (in green) the only two characteristics of these 
methods that are equal.

{\bf Computational efficiency}


Lelièvre and Oldenburg’s (2009) methods requires a costly computational 
effort (a large amount of memory storage and processing time). This 
disadvantage requires computational strategies to handle with a 
large-scale 3D inversion which were not mentioned by Lelièvre and 
Oldenburg (2009). The price paid for estimating the 3D magnetization 
vector distribution through the solution of a constrained nonlinear 
optimization problem is the disadvantage of dealing with intractable 
large-scale 3-D inversion. Hence, the computational inefficiency 
is one of the disadvantages of Lelièvre and Oldenburg’s (2009) methods.

Our method estimates a single magnetization vector per magnetic anomaly 
through the solution of a linear inverse problem or a nonlinear inverse 
problem.  Our method requires neither high-speed computers nor efficient 
computational strategies. The practical implementation of our method is 
very simple and its application is extremely fast. Hence, the major 
advantage of our method is its computational efficiency that allows a 
rapid estimation of the magnetization direction (inclination and 
declination) per magnetic anomaly. One might think that our method 
requires a signal separation to isolate the effect of a single 
well-defined peak per anomaly. This is not true.  Our method requires 
only that each magnetic anomaly be identified by the interpreter. Thus, 
we can estimate the magnetization vectors of multiple sources by 
inverting a large magnetic data set; however each one estimate will 
be associated to a single magnetic anomaly previously identified by 
the interpreter.


{\bf Ill-posed vs. well-posed inverse problems}


We recall that the nonuniqueness of the geophysical problem is caused 
by the insufficient information in the geophysical data. Particularly, 
the main ambiguity in geophysical interpretation is the one involving 
the physical property and the volume of the source. There is NO WAY to 
estimate both at the same time just from the data. As a result, if 
details about the source shape are required by the interpreter, the 
introduction of a large amount of strong constraints is mandatory. 
This is the case of the Lelièvre and Oldenburg’s (2009) method. 
These authors are using strong constraints because they are trying 
to retrieve both the shapes and the magnetization directions of the 
sources at each small volume (prism) of the 
$m_{x} \times m_{y} \times  m_{z}$ grid of 3D juxtaposed prisms in 
the horizontal and vertical directions.

Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009) deal with a high degree of nonuniqueness 
(an ill-posed inverse problem).  To transform this ill-posed inverse 
problem into a well-posed one, Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009) use 
supplementary information (constraints).  This means that Lelièvre 
and Oldenburg’s (2009) methods requires {\bf a plethora of inversion 
control variables}. Explicitly, in their equations 19, 22 and 26,
there are two inversion control variables ($\beta$ and $\gamma$) and
six vectors of reference models ($\mathbf{p}_{ref}$, $\mathbf{t}_{ref}$,
$\mathbf{s}_{ref}$, $\mathbf{a}_{ref}$, $\mathbf{\theta}_{ref}$,
and $\mathbf{\phi}_{ref}$). Besides, their equations 22 and 26 require 
much more inversion control variables, which are associated with the 
regularization functions $\mathbf{W}_{p}$, $\mathbf{W}_{s}$,
$\mathbf{W}_{t}$, $\mathbf{W}_{a}$, $\mathbf{W}_{\theta}$, and
$\mathbf{W}_{\phi}$. These regularization functions are equivalent 
to the regularization function ${\mathbf{W}_{m}$ and the 
depth weighting function in Li and Oldenburg, 1996. The inversion 
control variables associated with the regularization functions and 
the depth weighting function were omitted in the Lelièvre and 
Oldenburg (2009). {\bf The definition of an overabundance of inversion 
control variables is not a trivial task}.  Hence, this is one of 
the disadvantages of this method.

Our method in this manuscript reduces the demand of information of 
the magnetic sources. By assuming a spherical source, our method 
estimates a single magnetization vector per magnetic anomaly. 
As a result, the ambiguity involving the physical property (the 
magnetization vector, i.e., the magnetization intensity, 
inclination and declination) and volume is not 
present because we assume a spherical source. Hence, we propose 
in this manuscript a well-posed inverse problem of estimating a 
single magnetization direction per anomaly by using the assumption 
that the magnetic source is a sphere. Hence, our method does not 
require constraints and the inversion control variables.

Conceptually, Lelièvre and Oldenburg’s (2009) method seems a 
flexible method because it estimates a 3D magnetization vector 
distribution of the entire subsurface region containing the 
anomalous source. However, it does not mean that it is feasible. 
A concrete example of its unfeasibility is the real application 
presented in Lelièvre and Oldenburg's (2009) method. This 
inversion does not provide the magnetization direction of the 
sources.

\bigskip

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "The same overdetermined 
problem can be solved by the methods of Lelievre, Ellis et al.."}

\bigskip

We fully disagree with your comment. In Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009), 
the 3D magnetization vector distribution is estimated by solving a 
large-scale 3D constrained nonlinear inversion (their Equations 21-22 
and 25-26) that involves the number of data $N$ and the number of 
prisms $M$ of the interpretation model multiplied by three (i.e, $3M$ 
their equation 7). Indeed, if  $N < 3M$, the Lelièvre and Oldenburg’s 
(2009) method can be formulated as an overdetermined problem. However, 
we stress that usually we deal with a massive magnetic data set. Hence, 
$N$ can be smaller than $3M$, however $N$ will not be much smaller 
than $3M$.

\bigskip

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "As such, there is little new material 
here and I don’t see what value this paper adds to the scientific community"}

\bigskip

We fully disagree with you. We presented a {\bf new} and {\bf very fast} total-field 
anomaly inversion to estimate the magnetization direction of multiple 
sources. The main advantages of our method are: 1) the simplicity in 
implementation, 2) the low computational effort and 3) the extremely 
rapid estimation of the magnetization direction (inclination and 
declination) per magnetic anomaly. 

We formulate a well-posed magnetic inversion by assuming spherical 
shapes for the sources. One might think that it could be a severe 
restriction in applying our method. However, we take advantage of 
the upward continuation of the total-field anomaly to make possible 
the application of our method to interpret non-spherical sources. 
We illustrate the robustness of our method against non-spherical 
sources by inverting non-dipolar total-field anomalies. We show 
that the upward continuation is useful for overcoming the 
difficulties in the interpretation of strongly non-dipolar 
total-field anomalies (see subsection 3.3 Robustness against 
non-spherical sources). Our method requires the $x$-, $y$- 
and $z$-coordinates of the centre of the magnetic source. We 
show that the estimate of the magnetic direction (declination 
and inclination) is less sensitive to a wrong choice for the 
depth of the centre of the source than the horizontal coordinates 
of the centre of the source. Hence, a wrong choice of the depth 
of the centre of the source can be assumed by our method. 
However, we cannot assume a wrong choice of the horizontal 
coordinates of the centre of the source; otherwise our method 
estimates an incorrect magnetization direction of the source.

\bigskip

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "The authors’ suggestion of 
upward continuation to aid the applicability of their methods is 
not particularly insightful: the response of nondipole sources 
look more and more like dipole responses as the data measurement 
level is moved further from the sources (this is a well known 
phenomenon)."}

\bigskip

{\bf We neither suggest nor claim that the use of upward continuation 
in our manuscript is insightful. We explicitly apply the upward 
continuation because this is well-known phenomenon}, i.e., {\it the greater 
the distance between the sources and the data, the greater the 
attenuation of the non-dipolar features}. This emphasized sentence 
in italic is {\bf explicitly stated in our manuscript (see page 20)}. 
Our synthetic and real tests show how the upward continuation can be 
used to make possible the application of our method to interpret 
non-spherical sources.

\bigskip

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "There is a tremendous amount of 
prior knowledge required about the sources to use these  methods, 
despite the authors claiming the opposite in their conclusion: 
one must assume the sources are somewhat spherical, and one must 
have a reliable estimate of the number of sources and their locations 
(lateral and depth)."}

\bigskip

We fully disagree with you. You are confusing {\bf ASSUMED PREMISE} 
and {\bf PRIOR INFORMATION}. Let us clarify 
these topics.

{\bf THE ASSUMED PREMISE IN OUR METHOD} - We {\underline assumed a 
magnetized spherical source} giving rise to dipolar anomalies. 
Notice that {\bf it does not mean that the source must be a sphere}. 
We show the feasibility of applying the upward continuation to 
interpret non-spherical sources by using synthetic tests. We 
{\bf simulated 11 prismatic sources} with different side lengths 
$Lx$, $Ly$ and $Lz$ (Figure 4 in our manuscript displays three prisms) 
giving rise to non-dipolar total field anomalies. Figure 5 (in our 
manuscript) displays the total field anomalies produced by three 
prismatic sources at the plane $z = 0$ unit (Fig 5a-c) and the 
upward-continued anomalies at $z = -0.3$ unit (Fig 5 d-f) and at 
$z = -0.6$ unit (Fig 5 g-i). By inverting the upward-continued 
anomalies (e.g., Fig. 5d–i), the least-squares estimates are 
approximately similar to the robust estimates (Fig. 6c–f). Hence, 
Figure 6c-f shows that the estimated declination and declination 
by inverting the upward-continued anomalies (e.g., Fig. 5d–i) 
{\bf are in close agreement with true magnetization direction of 
the 11 simulated non-spherical sources}. \textcolor{red}{Besides, 
in this review we simulated other examples of non-spherical 
sources} (the results
can be found at
\href{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies/blob/master/notebooks/suppl_tests/comparison_sphere_cube/synthetic_tests_sphere_prism.ipynb}{\textcolor{blue}{link 1}},

). Among these additional tests, we not only illustrate the application of
our method to interpret simple sources, but also show the performance 
of our method in estimating the magnetization direction of synthetic models 
similar to that ones presented by Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009) and 
Ellis, Wet and Macleod (2012).

{\bf THE PRIOR INFORMATION REQUIRED BY OUR METHOD} – Our method requires the 
$x$-, $y$- and $z$-coordinates of the centre of the magnetic source. We 
investigate the sensitivity of our method to uncertainties in the a priori 
information (i.e., location of the centre of the magnetic source). 
Figure 7 in our manuscript shows that the wrong choice of the $x$ and $y$ 
coordinates of the centre of the source leads to poor estimates of the 
magnetization direction (declinations and inclinations in Fig. 7a–d) 
when compared with the true magnetization vector (continuous black 
lines in Fig. 7). On the other hand, the estimated declinations and 
inclinations are less sensitive to the wrong choice of the $z$ coordinate 
of the centre of the source (Fig. 7e and f). Figure 7 {\bf shows 126 (one 
hundred and twenty six)} inversions by presuming different positions of
$x$-, $y$- and $z$-coordinates of the centre of the source. These results 
show that our method is more sensitive to errors in the assumed horizontal 
coordinates of the centre of the source ($x$- and $y$-coordinates) than 
in the assumed the depth ($z$-coordinate) of centre of the source. Hence, 
the wrong choice of the depth of the centre of the source does not prevent 
the correct estimation of the magnetization direction (declination and 
inclination). Rather, the wrong choice of the horizontal coordinates of 
the centre of the source prevents the correct estimation of the magnetic 
direction.

In our manuscript, we stated that we use the Euler deconvolution to 
estimate $x$-, $y$- and $z$-coordinates of the centre of the 
magnetic source. We explicitly stated “{\it One might think that the 
high sensitivity of our method to uncertainties in the horizontal 
coordinates of the centres of the sources is a drawback. This is 
not true because these coordinates are generally well estimated by 
the Euler deconvolution}”. The horizontal position estimates by 
Euler deconvolution is unique and stable (Silva and Barbosa, 2003) 
even in the presence of noise and wrong structural index. Hence, 
{\bf the horizontal coordinates are well estimated by the Euler 
deconvolution}. Of course, if the bodies yield strong-interfering 
anomalies the Euler deconvolution fails in estimating the $x$- 
and $y$-coordinates of the bodies and thus the magnetization 
direction will be wrongly estimated by our method. In our 
manuscript, {\bf we present 126 (one hundred and twenty six)} 
inversions by presuming different positions of $x$-, $y$- 
and $z$-coordinates of the centre of the source (Figure 7) and 
\textcolor{red}{in this review we simulated other examples 
evaluating the sensitive to uncertainties in the a priori 
information about the horizontal coordinates of the centre 
of the non-spherical sources} (the results
can be found at 
\href{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies/blob/master/notebooks/suppl_tests/comparison_sphere_cube/synthetic_tests_sphere_prism.ipynb}{\textcolor{blue}{link 1}},

). 

Finally, we stress that, in our method, the prior information and the 
assumed premises are {\bf explicitly} stated. They are not hidden in the 
constraints (e.g., regularizing functions and depth weighting function). 
Besides, the solution sensitivity to uncertainties in defining the 
prior information and the assumed premises are widely tested by using 
synthetic tests. Hence, the advantages and restrictions of our method 
were analysed in our manuscript.

\bigskip

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "As such, I don’t see these 
methods being widely applicable."}

\bigskip

We fully disagree with you. We presented a {\bf very fast} and 
well-posed magnetic inversion to estimate the magnetization 
direction of multiple sources. Our method deals with a 
{\bf very small} optimization problem that leads to fast 
inversion times and low memory usage, making viable the 
inversion of large data sets {\bf without needing 
supercomputers} or {\bf data compression algorithms}. We are 
solving a well-posed inverse problem of estimating a single 
magnetization direction per anomaly by using the assumption 
that the magnetic source is a sphere. Hence, {\bf our method 
does not require a large amount of constraints and their 
inversion control variables}.

Our method, {\bf as all methods}, presents {\bf advantages 
and restrictions}. The advantages and restrictions make a 
given method more suitable to be used under a given available 
amount of a priori geological information about the sources. 
{\bf There is no universal inversion method applicable to all 
geological settings}. Rather, an inversion method can be 
applied only to a specific geological setting because of the 
inevitable bias imposed either by the stabilizing constraints 
or by the assumed premise. Moreover, the {\bf practical 
applicability of a method also depends on its computational 
feasibility}. An intractable large-scale 3D inversion 
usually requires: 1) large amount of constraints, 2) 
large amount of inversion control variables, 3) 
supercomputers or clusters of computers and 4) data 
compression algorithms. Finally, {\bf the practical 
applicability of a method also depends on its reproducibility}. 
The reproducibility is one of the main principles of the 
scientific method. All the specific variables of the synthetic 
and real tests must be present in the text, so that the work 
is reproducible. Without reproducibility, experimental trials 
that confirm or deny a given hypothesis cannot be confirmed 
by other scientists. In our manuscript, the premises, the prior 
information and the variables used for simulating our tests 
are explicitly present in the text. Besides, we have already 
made available (see this
\href{http://fatiando.readthedocs.org/en/v0.3/api/gravmag.magdir.html#module-fatiando.gravmag.magdir}{\textcolor{blue}{link}}) 
the code of our program to be used by other 
scientists. Our method is part of the open-source Python 
toolkit for geophysical modeling and inversion called
\href{http://fatiando.org/}{\textcolor{blue}{Fatiando a Terra}}.
