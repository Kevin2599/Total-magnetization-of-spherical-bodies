Reply to P. Lelièvre's Comment on "Estimation of the total magnetization direction of approximately spherical bodies"

\noindent{\bf General comments}



\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "The forward problem described 
is essentially identical to a mesh-based discretization but with 
the space-filling mesh cells (prisms, tetrahedra, etc) replaced 
with spherical (dipole) sources. Hence, the methods presented are 
essentially identical to those used by Lelievre and Oldenburg (2009) 
and Ellis et al. (2012)."}



We fully disagree with your comment that the forward problem in 
our method is \textcolor{red}{essentially} identical to the one 
adopted by Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009). 


The interpretation model 
adopted by Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009) consists of an 
$m_{x} \times m_{y} \times m_{z}$ grid of 3D juxtaposed prisms in 
the horizontal and vertical directions (\textcolor{red}{Figure 1a ???}). 
Hence, in the 
Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009) the associated forward model 
(their equation 10) requires computing the $N$ by $3M$ full 
sensitivity matrix being $N$ the number of data and $M$ the number 
of prisms of the interpretation model. A large data set combined 
with the discretization of the Earth’s subsurface into a fine grid 
of prisms results in a large-scale 3D forward model. Notice that 
in our method we {\bf do not} discretize the earth’s subsurface into an 
$m_{x} \times m_{y} \times m_{z}$ grid of 3D juxtaposed dipoles in 
the horizontal and vertical directions.  Hence, our interpretation 
model does not consist of a 3D, equally spaced array of dipoles.
Rather, the forward problem adopted by our method consists of a 
set of $L$ dipoles (Figure 1 of our manuscript). Hence, in our method 
the associated forward model (our equation 16) requires computing 
the $N$ by $3L$ sensitivity matrix where $L <<<<< M$. Thus, our method 
deals with a small-scale forward model being completely different 
from the one adopted by Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009).



\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "The difference is that where Lelièvre, 
Ellis et al. develop methods to solve an underdetermined inverse problem (many 
more mesh cells than data observations), the authors of this manuscript only 
consider the solution of a simpler overdetermined problem (far fewer source 
parameters than data observations)."}



We agree that Lelièvre and Oldenburg’ (2009) method solves an 
underdetermined inverse problem while our method solves an 
overdetermined problem. However, this characteristic is not the 
unique difference between these approaches. \textcolor{red}{Table ???} 
presents a list of the characteristics found in Lelièvre and 
Oldenburg’ (2009) method in comparison with those found in our 
method in this manuscript. By analyzing the Table below, we can 
easily conclude that these methods are substantially different. 
We highlighted (in green) the only two characteristics of these 
methods that are equal.

{\bf Computational efficiency}


Lelièvre and Oldenburg’s (2009) methods requires a costly computational 
effort (a large amount of memory storage and processing time). This 
disadvantage requires computational strategies to handle with a 
large-scale 3D inversion which were not mentioned by Lelièvre and 
Oldenburg (2009). The price paid for estimating the 3D magnetization 
vector distribution through the solution of a constrained nonlinear 
optimization problem is the disadvantage of dealing with intractable 
large-scale 3-D inversion. Hence, the computational inefficiency 
is one of the disadvantages of Lelièvre and Oldenburg’s (2009) methods.

Our method estimates a single magnetization vector per magnetic anomaly 
through the solution of a linear inverse problem or a nonlinear inverse 
problem.  Our method requires neither high-speed computers nor efficient 
computational strategies. The practical implementation of our method is 
very simple and its application is extremely fast. Hence, the major 
advantage of our method is its computational efficiency that allows a 
rapid estimation of the magnetization direction (inclination and 
declination) per magnetic anomaly. One might think that our method 
requires a signal separation to isolate the effect of a single 
well-defined peak per anomaly. This is not true.  Our method requires 
only that each magnetic anomaly be identified by the interpreter. Thus, 
we can estimate the magnetization vectors of multiple sources by 
inverting a large magnetic data set; however each one estimate will 
be associated to a single magnetic anomaly previously identified by 
the interpreter.


{\bf Ill-posed vs. well-posed inverse problems}


We recall that the nonuniqueness of the geophysical problem is caused 
by the insufficient information in the geophysical data. Particularly, 
the main ambiguity in geophysical interpretation is the one involving 
the physical property and the volume of the source. There is NO WAY to 
estimate both at the same time just from the data. As a result, if 
details about the source shape are required by the interpreter, the 
introduction of a large amount of strong constraints is mandatory. 
This is the case of the Lelièvre and Oldenburg’s (2009) method. 
These authors are using strong constraints because they are trying 
to retrieve both the shapes and the magnetization directions of the 
sources at each small volume (prism) of the 
$m_{x} \times m_{y} \times  m_{z}$ grid of 3D juxtaposed prisms in 
the horizontal and vertical directions (\textcolor{red}{Figure 1a ????}).
