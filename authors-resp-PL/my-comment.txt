Reply to P. Lelièvre's Comment on "Estimation of the total magnetization direction of approximately spherical bodies"

\noindent{\bf General comments}

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "The forward problem described 
is essentially identical to a mesh-based discretization but with 
the space-filling mesh cells (prisms, tetrahedra, etc) replaced 
with spherical (dipole) sources. Hence, the methods presented are 
essentially identical to those used by Lelievre and Oldenburg (2009) 
and Ellis et al. (2012)."}

We fully disagree with your comment that the forward problem in 
our method is \textcolor{red}{essentially} identical to the one 
adopted by Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009). 


The interpretation model 
adopted by Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009) consists of an 
$m_{x} \times m_{y} \times m_{z}$ grid of 3D juxtaposed prisms in 
the horizontal and vertical directions (Figure 1a). Hence, in the 
Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009) the associated forward model 
(their equation 10) requires computing the $N$ by $3M$ full 
sensitivity matrix being $N$ the number of data and $M$ the number 
of prisms of the interpretation model. A large data set combined 
with the discretization of the Earth’s subsurface into a fine grid 
of prisms results in a large-scale 3D forward model. Notice that 
in our method we do not discretize the earth’s subsurface into an 
$m_{x} \times m_{y} \times m_{z}$ grid of 3D juxtaposed dipoles in 
the horizontal and vertical directions.  Hence, our interpretation 
model does not consist of a 3D, equally spaced array of dipoles.
Rather, the forward problem adopted by our method consists of a 
set of $L$ dipoles (Figure 1 of our manuscript). Hence, in our method 
the associated forward model (our equation 16) requires computing 
the $N$ by $3L$ sensitivity matrix where $L <<<<< M$. Thus, our method 
deals with a small-scale forward model being completely different 
from the one adopted by Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009).


We agree that Lelièvre and Oldenburg’ (2009) method solves an 
underdetermined inverse problem while our method solves an 
overdetermined problem. However, this characteristic is not the 
unique difference between these approaches. Table \ref{differences} 
presents a list of the characteristics found in Lelièvre and 
Oldenburg’ (2009) method in comparison with those found in our 
method in this manuscript. By analyzing the Table below, we can 
easily conclude that these methods are substantially different. 
We highlighted (in green) the only two characteristics of these 
methods that are equal.

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "Page 2 Sentence starting Line 19: These results 
show that the non-outcropping sources near from the alkaline complex of Diorama have 
almost the same magnetization direction of that as the ones in the alkaline complex 
of Montes Claros de Goiás, strongly suggesting that these sources have been emplaced 
in the crust almost within the same geological time interval."}
