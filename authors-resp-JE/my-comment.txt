Reply to J. Ebbing's Comment on "Estimation of the total magnetization direction of approximately spherical bodies"

We would like to thank Referee J. Ebbing for his constructive comments. Below we present our comments on his recommendations.

\noindent{\bf General comments}

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "First, the magnetization direction of the spherical body is inverted and afterwards the 
magnetization of the prism to study the error introduced by a non-spherical geometry. But at the same time the inclination and 
declination are changed, so that no direct comparison with the inversion for the spherical body is possible. I would suggest 
inverting first for the same parameters, but by only changing geometry and in the second step changing inclination and 
declination more drastically compared to the applied inducing field. If the method is supposed to be able to resolve 
remanent magnetization, it would be interesting to see how the method performs for anomalies with reversed magnetization."}

Thank you very much. To adress this recommendation, we have applied our method to estimate 
the magnetization direction of two synthetic bodies with the same magnetization and different 
geometries. The first one is a sphere with radius $R = 2000 \, m$ and the second synthetic 
body is a cube with length side $R = 2000 \, m$. The centers of these two synthetic bodies 
are located at the same Cartesian coordinates $x_{0} = 0 \, m$, $y_{0} = 0 \, m$ and $z_{0} = 2000 \, m$. 
They also have the same magnetization vector with inclination $-9.5^{\circ}$, declination $-167^{\circ}$ 
and intensity $3.5 \, A/m$. The simulated geomagnetic field has inclination $9.5^{\circ}$ and 
declination $13^{\circ}$. Note that the synthetic bodies have reversed magnetization. 
The total-field anomaly produced by these bodies were calculated on the same regular 
grid with constant vertical coordinate $z = -150 \, m$. These data were corrupted with 
a pseudo-random Gaussian noise of null mean and standard deviation $5 \, nT$.

By applying our method to the magnetic data produced by the synthetic sphere, we obtained 
the estimated inclinations $\hat{I} = -9.49770^{\circ} \pm 0.00036^{\circ}$ and 
$\tilde{I} = -9.50764^{\circ} \pm 0.01022^{\circ}$ and declinations 
$\hat{D} = -167.01021^{\circ} \pm 0.00069^{\circ}$ and $\tilde{D} =
-166.98518^{\circ} \pm 0.07527^{\circ}$. In the case of the synthetic data produced by 
the cube, we obtained the estimated inclinations $\hat{I} = -9.58948^{\circ} \pm 0.00026^{\circ}$ 
and $\tilde{I} = -8.86599^{\circ} \pm 0.00876^{\circ}$ and declinations 
$\hat{D} = -164.57023^{\circ} \pm 0.00049^{\circ}$ and $\tilde{D} =
-167.34047^{\circ} \pm 0.01028^{\circ}$. The caret ($^{\wedge}$) and tilde
($^{\sim}$) denote the results computed by using, respectively, the least-squares and 
robust estimates. These results show the good performance of our method in retrieving the 
true magnetization direction of the sphere and the cube. The direct comparison between these 
results shows the robustness of our method in estimating the magnetization of a non-spherical 
source. The numerical code used to produce these results can be found

In this test, we calculated the noise-corrupted total-field anomalies close to the sources. 
In this case, the total-field anomaly produced by the cube exhibits non-dipolar features being 
very different from the one produced by the sphere. As shown in the section 3.3 (Robustness 
against non-spherical sources) of our manuscript, these non-dipolar features are attenuated 
if the data are calculated or measured far from the sources and this attenuation is more 
noticeable if the sources possess symmetry around three orthogonal axis (like the cube 
presented here). In the section 3.3 of our manuscript, we present the effects of these 
two factors: (1) the distance between the data (the magnetometer) and the source and (2) 
the symmetry of the source. These effects are analyzed by applying our method to 33 different 
synthetic-data sets.

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "All the inversions presented consider that the location 
of the source body is known."}

The section 3.4 (Robustness against errors in the centre location) in our manuscript
shows how the errors in the coordinates of the centre of the source affect the results
obtained with our method. In this section, we show the results obtained by wrongly assuming
different locations of the centre of the simulated spherical source along three
orthogonal straight lines which are parallel to the x, y and z axis and cross the centre
of the true source. Along each line, we applied our method by considering that the
centre of the source is erroneously located at 21 regularly spaced points, totalling 63
inversions obtained with the least-squares approach and 63 inversion obtained with the
robust approach. The results obtained in all these 126 inversions are shown in Fig. 7.
According to these results, our method is more sensitive to uncertainties in the prior
information about the horizontal coordinates of the centre of the source along the 
horizontal directions than about the depth of the centre of the source.

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "If the position of the source is known for example 
from Euler Deconvolution, the estimate of the inclination and declination is almost trivial 
even by forward modelling."}

We disagree with you. The estimation of the magnetization direction of a 3D source may be 
a difficult task, especially if it is done by forward modelling. The estimation of the 
magnetization direction of a 3D source might be easy if the source is symmetrical, with 
known shape and if there is no interfering anomalies. This is shown in the section 3.1 
(Validation test) of our manuscript. As shown in the section 3.2 (Robustness against 
interfering anomalies) of our manuscript, the presence of interfering anomalies can 
mislead the estimation of the magnetization direction even if the magnetic data are 
produced by simple sources with known centres. The estimation of the magnetization 
direction of 3D sources can also be difficult if the total-field anomaly displays 
strongly non-dipolar features, as illustrated by the Figures 5a-c of our manuscript. 
In these examples, even if the interpreter knew the centre of the source, the estimation 
of the magnetization direction by using forward modelling would be very difficult.

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "More interesting would be an example, where 
a regional field superposes the local anomaly or to some degree two anomalies 
overlap. Euler Deconvolution will provide results in both cases, but with less 
confidence in the horizontal position, which will affect the magnetization
directions."}

Thank you for this very good suggestion. We follow this suggestion by applying
our method to estimate the magnetization direction of a synthetic igneous 
intrusion formed by a sill which is fed by a vertical pipe. The numerical 
code used to produce this test can be found
\href{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies/blob/authors-resp-JE/notebooks/suppl_tests/complex/complex_test.ipynb}{\textcolor{blue}{here}}.
The simulated geomagnetic field has inclination $-39.8^{\circ}$ 
and declination $-22.5^{\circ}$. The synthetic intrusion has a
reversed magnetization with inclination $I = 140.2^{\circ}$ and
declination $D = 157.5^{\circ}$. This intrusion
is emplaced in weakly-magnetized sediments that are 
placed over a basement which is magnetized by induction. In this example, the 
total-field anomaly 
predicted by the intrusion overlaps the one produced by the
basement. Our method is applied to the noise-corrupted total-field 
anomaly produced by the intrusion + basement on a regular grid 
with constant vertical coordinate. The position of the synthetic 
intrusion is estimated by Euler Deconvolution. The synthetic 
intrusion is not an ideal source and then does not have a 
characteristic structural index. In this case, we presume that the 
noise-corrupted total-field anomaly is produced by an spherical 
body and use a structural index equal to 3. As shown
\href{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies/blob/authors-resp-JE/notebooks/suppl_tests/complex/complex_test.ipynb}{\textcolor{blue}{here}},
the estimated location obtained by Euler Deconvolution is placed outside
the synthetic intrusion. Even using this poor estimation of the location
of the source, our method obtained the estimated inclinations 
$\hat{I} = 142.36274^{\circ} \pm 0.00035^{\circ}$ 
and $\tilde{I} = 138.00578^{\circ} \pm 0.00946^{\circ}$ and declinations 
$\hat{D} = 168.58910^{\circ} \pm 0.00061^{\circ}$ and $\tilde{D} =
167.04275^{\circ} \pm 0.02352^{\circ}$. The caret ($^{\wedge}$) and tilde
($^{\sim}$) denote the results computed by using, respectively, the least-squares and 
robust estimates.
This numerical test shows 
the robustness of our method when applied to retrieve the magnetization 
direction of a complex source whose centre is poorly estimated by Euler
Deconvolution. We also illustrate the use of the reduction 
to the pole to verify the quality of the estimated magnetization direction.
The reduction to the pole calculated with the magnetization direction
obtained by our method leads to a predominantly positive field, which
is very close to the true pole field.
