Reply to J. Ebbing's Comment on "Estimation of the total magnetization direction of approximately spherical bodies"

We would like to thank Referee J. Ebbing for his constructive comments. Below we present our comments on his recommendations.

\noindent{\bf General comments}

Referee's comment: {\it "First, the magnetization direction of the spherical body is inverted and afterwards the magnetization of the prism to study the error introduced by a non-spherical geometry. But at the same time the inclination and declination are changed, so that no direct comparison with the inversion for the spherical body is possible. I would suggest inverting first for the same parameters, but by only changing geometry and in the second step changing inclination and declination more drastically compared to the applied inducing field. If the method is supposed to be able to resolve remanent magnetization, it would be interesting to see how the method performs for anomalies with reversed magnetization."}

Thank you very much. To adress this recommendation, we have applied our method to estimate the magnetization direction of two synthetic bodies with the same magnetization and different geometries. The first one is a sphere with radius $R = 2000 \, m$ and the second synthetic body is a cube with length side $R = 2000 \, m$. The centers of these two synthetic bodies are located at the same Cartesian coordinates $x_{0} = 0 \, m$, $y_{0} = 0 \, m$ and $z_{0} = 2000 \, m$. They also have the same magnetization vector with inclination $-9.5^{\circ}$, declination $-167^{\circ}$ and intensity $3.5 \, A/m$. The simulated geomagnetic field has inclination $9.5^{\circ}$ and declination $13^{\circ}$. Note that the synthetic bodies have reversed magnetization. The total-field anomaly produced by these bodies were calculated on the same regular grid with constant vertical coordinate $z = -150 \, m$. These data were corrupted with a pseudo-random Gaussian noise of null mean and standard deviation $5 \, nT$.

We obtained the estimated inclinations $\hat{I} = -9.49770^{\circ} \pm 0.00036^{\circ}$ and $\tilde{I} = -9.50764^{\circ} \pm 0.01022^{\circ}$ and declinations $\hat{D} = -167.01021^{\circ} \pm 0.00069^{\circ}$ and $\tilde{D} =
-166.98518^{\circ} \pm 0.07527^{\circ}$ for the synthetic sphere. For the synthetic cube, we obtained the estimated inclinations $\hat{I} = -9.58948^{\circ} \pm 0.00026^{\circ}$ and $\tilde{I} = -8.86599^{\circ} \pm 0.00876^{\circ}$ and declinations $\hat{D} = -164.57023^{\circ} \pm 0.00049^{\circ}$ and $\tilde{D} =
-167.34047^{\circ} \pm 0.01028^{\circ}$. The caret ($^{\wedge}$) and tilde
($^{\sim}$) denote the results computed by using, respectively, the least-squares and robust estimates. These results show the good performance of our method in retrieving the true magnetization direction of the sphere and the cube. The direct comparison between these results shows the robustness of our method in estimating the magnetization of a non-spherical source. The numerical code used to produce these results can be found \href{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies/blob/authors-resp-JE/notebooks/suppl_tests/comparison_sphere_cube/synthetic_tests_sphere_prism.ipynb}{\textcolor{blue}{here}}.

In this test, we calculated the noise-corrupted total-field anomalies near from the sources. In this case, the total-field anomaly produced by the cube is very different from that one produced by the sphere and exhibit non-dipolar features. As shown in the section 3.3 (Robustness against non-spherical sources) of the manuscript, these non-dipolar features are attenuated if the data are calculated far from the sources and this attenuation is more noticeable for sources presenting symmetry around three orthogonal axis (like the cube presented here). In the section 3.3 of the manuscript, we present the effects of these two factors (distance between data and source and symmetry of the source) on the results obtained by applying our method to 33 different synthetic-data sets.

Referee's comment: {\it "All the inversions presented consider that the location of the source body is known."}

In the section 3.4 (Robustness against errors in the centre location) of the manuscript, we present how the errors in the coordinates of the centre of the source affect the results obtained with our method. In that section, we show
