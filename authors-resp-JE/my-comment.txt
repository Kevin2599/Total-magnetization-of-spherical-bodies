Reply to J. Ebbing's Comment on "Estimation of the total magnetization direction of approximately spherical bodies"

We would like to thank Referee J. Ebbing for his constructive and insightful comments.
Below we present our comments and responses to his recommendations.
We have performed several new tests on synthetic data that we hope will answer
all of the points raised by the Referee.
The results, figures, and source code for these tests are available online
through the code hosting website Github at
\href{https://github.com/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies}{\textcolor{blue}{github.com/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies}}.
Links to each specific synthetic test are provided in the relevant comments

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "First, the magnetization direction of the spherical body is inverted and afterwards the
magnetization of the prism to study the error introduced by a non-spherical geometry. But at the same time the inclination and
declination are changed, so that no direct comparison with the inversion for the spherical body is possible. I would suggest
inverting first for the same parameters, but by only changing geometry and in the second step changing inclination and
declination more drastically compared to the applied inducing field. If the method is supposed to be able to resolve
remanent magnetization, it would be interesting to see how the method performs for anomalies with reversed magnetization."}

Thank you very much for this suggestion.
We have made a new test on synthetic data
in which we applied our method to
a sphere and a prism with the same magnetization.
The results, figures, and numerical code
used to produce these results can be found
online in the IPython notebook (an interactive writing and programing
environment)
\href{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies/blob/master/notebooks/suppl_tests/comparison_sphere_cube/synthetic_tests_sphere_prism.ipynb}{\textcolor{blue}{synthetic_tests_sphere_prism.ipynb}}.

The sphere has a radius $R = 2000 \, m$ and
the cube has a side length $R = 2000 \, m$.
The centers of these two bodies are located at the same Cartesian coordinates
$x_{0} = 0 \, m$, $y_{0} = 0 \, m$ and $z_{0} = 2000 \, m$.
They also have the same magnetization vector,
with inclination $-9.5^{\circ}$, declination $-167^{\circ}$
and intensity $3.5 \, A/m$. The simulated geomagnetic field has inclination $9.5^{\circ}$ and
declination $13^{\circ}$.
Note that both bodies have reversed magnetization,
following the suggestion of the reviewer.
The total-field anomaly produced by these bodies
were calculated on the same regular grid
with constant vertical coordinate $z = -150 \, m$. These data were corrupted with
a pseudo-random Gaussian noise of null mean and standard deviation $5 \, nT$.

Applying our method to the sphere,
we obtained the estimated inclinations
$\hat{I} = -9.49770^{\circ} \pm 0.00036^{\circ}$ and
$\tilde{I} = -9.50764^{\circ} \pm 0.01022^{\circ}$
(the caret ``$^{\wedge}$'' and tilde ``$^{\sim}$''
denote the results computed by using, respectively, the least-squares and
robust estimates)
and declinations $\hat{D} = -167.01021^{\circ} \pm 0.00069^{\circ}$ and $\tilde{D} =
-166.98518^{\circ} \pm 0.07527^{\circ}$.
In the case of the synthetic data produced by the cube,
we obtained the estimated inclinations $\hat{I} = -9.58948^{\circ} \pm 0.00026^{\circ}$
and $\tilde{I} = -8.86599^{\circ} \pm 0.00876^{\circ}$ and declinations
$\hat{D} = -164.57023^{\circ} \pm 0.00049^{\circ}$ and $\tilde{D} =
-167.34047^{\circ} \pm 0.01028^{\circ}$.
The direct comparison between these
results shows the robustness of our method in estimating the magnetization
of a non-spherical source, even in the presence of reversed remanent
magnetization.

In this test, we calculated the noise-corrupted total-field anomalies close to the sources.
The total-field anomaly produced by the cube exhibits non-dipolar features being
very different from the one produced by the sphere. As shown in the section 3.3 (Robustness
against non-spherical sources) of our manuscript, these non-dipolar features are attenuated
if the data are calculated or measured far from the sources.
This attenuation is more
noticeable if the sources possess symmetry around three orthogonal axis (like the cube
presented here). In the section 3.3 of our manuscript, we present the effects of these
two factors: (1) the distance between the data (the magnetometer) and the source and (2)
the symmetry of the source. These effects are analyzed by applying our method to 33 different
synthetic-data sets.

\bigskip

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "All the inversions presented consider that the location
of the source body is known."}

\bigskip

Section 3.4 (Robustness against errors in the centre location) of our manuscript
shows how the errors in the coordinates of the centre of the source affect the results
obtained with our method. In this section, we assume
different locations of the centre of the simulated spherical source along three
orthogonal straight lines which are parallel to the x, y and z axis and cross the true centre
of the source. Along each line, we applied our method by considering that the
centre of the source is erroneously located at 21 regularly spaced points, totalling 63
inversions obtained with the least-squares approach and 63 inversion obtained with the
robust approach. The results obtained in all these 126 inversions are shown in Fig. 7.
According to these results, our method is more sensitive to uncertainties in the prior
information about the horizontal coordinates of the centre of the source along the
horizontal directions than about the depth of the centre of the source.

\bigskip

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "If the position of the source is known for example
from Euler Deconvolution, the estimate of the inclination and declination is almost trivial
even by forward modelling."}

\bigskip

We respectfully disagree.
Even if the interpreter knew the centre of the source, the estimation
of the magnetization direction by using interactive forward modelling would be a very
difficult task involving an exhaustive and time-consuming trial-and-error
procedure to yield an acceptable data fit.  On the other hand, any
inversion method  has the advantage, compared with forward modelling, of
automatically fitting observations.
The estimation of the
magnetization direction of a 3D source might be easy if the source is symmetrical, with
known shape and if there is no interfering anomalies. This is shown in the section 3.1
(Validation test) of our manuscript. On the other hand, as shown in the section 3.2
(Robustness against interfering anomalies), the presence of interfering
anomalies can mislead the estimation of the magnetization direction even if the magnetic
data are produced by simple sources with known centres. The estimation of the magnetization
direction of 3D sources can also be difficult if the total-field anomaly displays
strongly non-dipolar features, as illustrated by the Figures 5a-c of our manuscript.

\bigskip

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "More interesting would be an example, where
a regional field superposes the local anomaly or to some degree two anomalies
overlap. Euler Deconvolution will provide results in both cases, but with less
confidence in the horizontal position, which will affect the magnetization
directions."}

\bigskip

Thank you for this very good suggestion.
We have created a new test with synthetic data from an igneous
intrusion formed by a sill which is fed by a vertical pipe.
This intrusion
is embedded in weakly magnetized sediments that are
overlaying a basement which is magnetized by induction,
generating a regional anomaly.
The results, figures, and numerical code
used to produce these results can be found
online in the IPython notebook
\href{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies/blob/master/notebooks/suppl_tests/complex/complex_test.ipynb}{\textcolor{blue}{complex_test.ipynb}}.
The simulated geomagnetic field has inclination $-39.8^{\circ}$
and declination $-22.5^{\circ}$. The synthetic intrusion has a
reversed magnetization with inclination $I = 39.8^{\circ}$ and
declination $D = 157.5^{\circ}$. In this example, the
total-field anomaly
predicted by the intrusion overlaps the one produced by the
basement. Our method is applied to the noise-corrupted total-field
anomaly produced by both the intrusion and the basement on a regular grid
with constant vertical coordinate. The position of the synthetic
intrusion is estimated by Euler Deconvolution. The synthetic
intrusion is not an ideal source and does not have a
characteristic structural index. In this case, we presume that the
noise-corrupted total-field anomaly is produced by an spherical
body and use a structural index equal to 3.
The estimated location of the body obtained by Euler Deconvolution is placed outside
the synthetic intrusion. Even using this poor estimation of the location
of the source, our method obtained the estimated inclinations
$\hat{I} = 37.50377^{\circ} \pm 0.00035^{\circ}$
and $\tilde{I} = 40.25973^{\circ} \pm 0.04392^{\circ}$ and declinations
$\hat{D} = 167.61518^{\circ} \pm 0.00060^{\circ}$ and $\tilde{D} =
164.58968^{\circ} \pm 0.09092^{\circ}$. The caret ($^{\wedge}$) and tilde
($^{\sim}$) denote the results computed by using, respectively, the least-squares and
robust estimates.
This numerical test shows
the robustness of our method when applied to retrieve the magnetization
direction of a complex source whose centre is poorly estimated by Euler
Deconvolution. We also illustrate the use of the reduction
to the pole to verify the quality of the estimated magnetization direction.
The reduction to the pole calculated with the magnetization direction
obtained by our method leads to a predominantly positive field, which
is very close to the true pole field.

We have also run several additional tests showing the application of our method
to estimate the magnetization direction of different synthetic sources with
known and estimated centres (by using Euler Deconvolution).
The figures, results, and source code of the additional tests
obtained with the least-squares approach can be found
in the IPython notebook
\href{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies/blob/master/notebooks/suppl_tests/additional_tests/synthetic_tests-L2.ipynb}{\textcolor{blue}{synthetic_tests-L2.ipynb}}
and the results obtained with the robust approach can be found in
\href{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies/blob/master/notebooks/suppl_tests/additional_tests/synthetic_tests-L1.ipynb}{\textcolor{blue}{synthetic_tests-L1.ipynb}}.
One of these tests show the influence of a superposed constant-regional field (50 nT)
on the estimated magnetization direction. The regional
field does not lead to wrong estimates of the centres of the sources by Euler Deconvolution
because, in this case, this technique estimates a non-null base level. On the other
hand, this regional-constant field misleads the magnetization direction obtained
by our method. To overcome this problem, a regional-residual separation should be
done prior to estimation. Finally, these additional tests also show the performance
of our method in estimating the magnetization direction of synthetic models
similar to the ones presented by Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009) and Ellis, Wet and Macleod (2012).

in the crust almost within the same geological time interval."}
