#Additional tests

These numerical tests show the application of our method to estimate
the magnetization direction of different sources with known centres
and estimated centres (via Euler Deconvolution). Besides, these tests show
the influence of a superposed constant-regional field on the estimated magnetization 
direction. Finally, we show the performance of our method in
estimating the magnetization direction of synthetic models similar to that
ones presented by Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009) and Ellis, Wet and Macleod (2012).
