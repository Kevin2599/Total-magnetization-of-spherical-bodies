#Complex test

This numerical test show the application of our method to estimate
the magnetization direction of a synthetic intrusion formed by a
sill which is fed by a vertical pipe. This synthetic source crosses
weakly-magnetized sediments which are placed on a magnetized 
basement. Our method is applied to the noise-corrupted total-field 
anomaly produced by the intrusion + basement on a regular grid over 
with constant vertical coordinate. The position of the synthetic 
intrusion is estimated by Euler Deconvolution. The synthetic 
intrusion is not an ideal source and then does not have a 
characteristic structural index. In this case, we presume that the 
noise-corrupted total-field anomaly is produced by an spherical 
body and use a structural index equal to 3. The obtained results
can be seen [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies/blob/authors-resp-JE/notebooks/suppl_tests/complex/complex_test.ipynb). 
This numerical test shows the robustness of our method when applied to estimate the
magnetization direction of a complex source.
