#Comparison sphere versus cube

These numerical tests shows a direct comparison between the estimated 
magnetization direction of a synthetic sphere and a synthetic cube. The
radius of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. The synthetic
bodies also have the center located at the same Cartesian coordinates. The
can be seen [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies/blob/authors-resp-JE/notebooks/suppl_tests/comparison_sphere_cube/synthetic_tests_sphere_prism.ipynb)
