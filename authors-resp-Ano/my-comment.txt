We would like to thank the Anonymous Referee for his constructive comments. Below we present our comments on his recommendations.

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "In addition, I appreciate 
what is, to my knowledge, a rather comprehensive literature
review."}

\bigskip

Thank you. However, in this new version of the manuscript we have 
reduced the literature review following the suggestion raised  by 
one of the reviewers. 

\bigskip

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "The use of Euler Deconvolution
to compute the center of the sources, however, I believe is a 
dubious method given the extension of the method to non-spherical 
sources. Their comments regarding the usefulness of the technique 
to horizontal location is appreciated, but the example only
shows the technique applied to spherical bodies. I’d like an 
example of an off-center prism."}

Thank you very much. To adress this suggestion, we have proceeded
in the same way as described in the response to the Referee J. Ebbing. 
We have applied
our method to estimate the magnetization direction of a synthetic igneous 
intrusion formed by a sill which is fed by a vertical pipe. The numerical 
code used to produce this test can be found
\href{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies/blob/master/notebooks/suppl_tests/complex/complex_test.ipynb}{\textcolor{blue}{here}}.
The simulated geomagnetic field has inclination $-39.8^{\circ}$ 
and declination $-22.5^{\circ}$. The synthetic intrusion has a
reversed magnetization with inclination $I = 39.8^{\circ}$ and
declination $D = 157.5^{\circ}$. This intrusion
is emplaced in weakly magnetized sediments that are 
overlaying a basement which is magnetized by induction. In this example, the 
total-field anomaly 
predicted by the intrusion overlaps the one produced by the
basement. Our method is applied to the noise-corrupted total-field 
anomaly produced by both the intrusion and the basement on a regular grid 
with constant vertical coordinate. The position of the synthetic 
intrusion is estimated by Euler Deconvolution. The synthetic 
intrusion is not an ideal source and then does not have a 
characteristic structural index. In this case, we presume that the 
noise-corrupted total-field anomaly is produced by an spherical 
body and use a structural index equal to 3. As shown
\href{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies/blob/master/notebooks/suppl_tests/complex/complex_test.ipynb}{\textcolor{blue}{here}},
the estimated location of the body obtained by Euler Deconvolution is placed outside
the synthetic intrusion. Even using this poor estimation of the location
of the source, our method obtained the estimated inclinations 
$\hat{I} = 37.50377^{\circ} \pm 0.00035^{\circ}$ 
and $\tilde{I} = 40.25973^{\circ} \pm 0.04392^{\circ}$ and declinations 
$\hat{D} = 167.61518^{\circ} \pm 0.00060^{\circ}$ and $\tilde{D} =
164.58968^{\circ} \pm 0.09092^{\circ}$. The caret ($^{\wedge}$) and tilde
($^{\sim}$) denote the results computed by using, respectively, the least-squares and 
robust estimates.
This numerical test shows 
the robustness of our method when applied to retrieve the magnetization 
direction of a complex source whose centre is poorly estimated by Euler
Deconvolution. We also illustrate the use of the reduction 
to the pole to verify the quality of the estimated magnetization direction.
The reduction to the pole calculated with the magnetization direction
obtained by our method leads to a predominantly positive field, which
is very close to the true pole field (see \href{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies/blob/master/notebooks/suppl_tests/complex/complex_test.ipynb}{\textcolor{blue}{here}}).

We have also run several additional tests showing the application of our method 
to estimate the magnetization direction of different synthetic sources with 
known and estimated centres (by using Euler Deconvolution). 
The results obtained with the least-squares approach can be found
\href{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies/blob/master/notebooks/suppl_tests/additional_tests/synthetic_tests-L2.ipynb}{\textcolor{blue}{here}}
and the results obtained with the robust approach can be found
\href{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies/blob/master/notebooks/suppl_tests/additional_tests/synthetic_tests-L1.ipynb}{\textcolor{blue}{here}}.
One of these tests show the influence of a superposed constant-regional field (50 nT)
on the estimated magnetization direction. The superposed constant-regional
field does not lead to wrong estimates of the centres of the sources by Euler Deconvolution 
because, in this case, this technique estimates a non-null base level. On the other
hand, this regional-constant field misleads the magnetization direction obtained
by our method. To overcome this problem, a regional-residual separation should be
previously done. Finally, these additional tests also show the performance 
of our method in estimating the magnetization direction of synthetic models 
similar to that ones presented by Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009) and Ellis, Wet and Macleod (2012).

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "It’s fine to show the L2 results, 
but I’m not sure when one would not use the L1 in field data."}

\bigskip

The numerical results shown in our manuscript suggest the use of
the L1 norm to interpret both interfering magnetic anomalies 
(section 3.2 - Robustness against interfering anomalies) and 
non-dipolar total-field anomalies (section 3.3 
- Robustness against non-spherical sources). On the other 
hand, the results shown in section 3.4 (Robustness against 
errors in the centre location) suggest that the L2-norm approach
is slightly better than the L1-norm approach if there are errors 
in the vertical position of the centre of the source (Figures
7e and 7f of our manuscript). The presence of errors in the 
horizontal position of the source misleads the results 
obtained with both L1- and L2-approaches. In our opinion,
the L1-norm approach should be used to interpret field
data. We have stressed this aspect in the text of our 
manuscript.

\bigskip

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "If there is room, I’d like to 
see the total field data in the field example reduced to pole
as well, just for comparison."}

\bigskip

Sorry, but we are not sure if we have understood the goal of this 
comment, because Figure 10 of our manuscript shows the comparison 
between the reduced to pole anomalies obtained with L1- and L2-norm
appraches on a region of the Goiás Alkaline Province, Brazil. So, 
we have already shown your request.
