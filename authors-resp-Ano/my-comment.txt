Reply to Anonymous Referee's Comment on "Estimation of the total magnetization direction of approximately spherical bodies"

We would like to thank the Anonymous Referee for his/her constructive comments.
Below we present our comments and responses to the Referees recommendations.

We have performed several new tests on synthetic data in response to the
comments by all referees.
We hope they will answer all of the points raised by the Referee.
The results, figures, and source code for these tests are available online
through the code hosting website Github at
\href{https://github.com/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies}{\textcolor{blue}{github.com/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies}}.
Links to each specific synthetic test are provided in the relevant comments
below.

\noindent{\bf General comments}

\bigskip

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "In addition, I appreciate
what is, to my knowledge, a rather comprehensive literature
review."}

\bigskip

Thank you for your review.
In the revised version of the manuscript we have
added some new references.

\bigskip

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "The use of Euler Deconvolution
to compute the center of the sources, however, I believe is a
dubious method given the extension of the method to non-spherical
sources. Their comments regarding the usefulness of the technique
to horizontal location is appreciated, but the example only
shows the technique applied to spherical bodies. I’d like an
example of an off-center prism."}

\bigskip

That is a very good suggestion, thank you.
This same concern was expressed by another referee (J. Ebbing).
To address this suggestion,
we have made a new test on synthetic data
in which we applied our method to
data generated form a model of a weekly magnetized sedimentary basin and
an igneous intrusion formed by a sill which is fed by a vertical pipe.
The results, figures, and numerical code
used to produce these results can be found
online in the IPython notebook (an interactive writing and programing
environment)
\href{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies/blob/master/notebooks/suppl_tests/complex/complex_test.ipynb}{\textcolor{blue}{complex\_test.ipynb}}.


The simulated geomagnetic field has inclination $-39.8^{\circ}$
and declination $-22.5^{\circ}$. The synthetic intrusion has a
reversed magnetization with inclination $I = 39.8^{\circ}$ and
declination $D = 157.5^{\circ}$. This intrusion
is embedded in weakly magnetized sediments that are
overlaying a basement which is magnetized by induction. In this example, the
total-field anomaly
predicted by the intrusion overlaps the one produced by the
basement. Our method is applied to the noise-corrupted total-field
anomaly produced by both the intrusion and the basement on a regular grid
with constant vertical coordinate. The position of the synthetic
intrusion is estimated by Euler Deconvolution. The synthetic
intrusion is not an ideal source and then does not have a
characteristic structural index. In this case, we presume that the
noise-corrupted total-field anomaly is produced by an spherical
body and use a structural index equal to 3.
The estimated location of the body obtained by Euler Deconvolution is placed outside
the synthetic intrusion.
This is an extreme case of an ``off center prism'', as suggested by the
referee.

Even using this poor estimate of the location
of the source, our method estimated inclinations
$\hat{I} = 37.50377^{\circ} \pm 0.00035^{\circ}$
and $\tilde{I} = 40.25973^{\circ} \pm 0.04392^{\circ}$ and declinations
$\hat{D} = 167.61518^{\circ} \pm 0.00060^{\circ}$ and $\tilde{D} =
164.58968^{\circ} \pm 0.09092^{\circ}$. The caret ($^{\wedge}$) and tilde
($^{\sim}$) denote the results computed by using, respectively, the least-squares and
robust estimates.
This numerical test shows
the robustness of our method when applied to retrieve the magnetization
direction of a complex source whose centre is poorly estimated by Euler
Deconvolution. We also illustrate the use of the reduction
to the pole to verify the quality of the estimated magnetization direction.
The reduction to the pole calculated with the magnetization direction
obtained by our method leads to a predominantly positive field, which
is very close to the true pole field.

We have also run several additional tests showing the application of our method
to estimate the magnetization direction of different synthetic sources with
known and estimated centres (by using Euler Deconvolution).
The figures, results, and source code of the additional tests
obtained with the least-squares approach can be found
in the IPython notebook
\href{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies/blob/master/notebooks/suppl_tests/additional_tests/synthetic_tests-L2.ipynb}{\textcolor{blue}{synthetic\_tests-L2.ipynb}}
and the results obtained with the robust approach can be found in
\href{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/birocoles/Total-magnetization-of-spherical-bodies/blob/master/notebooks/suppl_tests/additional_tests/synthetic_tests-L1.ipynb}{\textcolor{blue}{synthetic\_tests-L1.ipynb}}.
One of these tests show the influence of a superposed constant-regional field (50 nT)
on the estimated magnetization direction. The regional
field does not lead to wrong estimates of the centres of the sources by Euler Deconvolution
because, in this case, this technique estimates a non-null base level. On the other
hand, this regional-constant field misleads the magnetization direction obtained
by our method. To overcome this problem, a regional-residual separation should be
done prior to estimation. Finally, these additional tests also show the performance
of our method in estimating the magnetization direction of synthetic models
similar to the ones presented by Lelièvre and Oldenburg (2009) and Ellis, Wet and Macleod (2012).

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "It’s fine to show the L2 results,
but I’m not sure when one would not use the L1 in field data."}

\bigskip

We agree, thank you for your comment. In our opinion,
the L1-norm approach should be used to interpret field
data. We have stressed this aspect in the text of our
manuscript.

The numerical results shown in our manuscript suggest the use of
the L1 norm to interpret both interfering magnetic anomalies
(section 3.2 - Robustness against interfering anomalies) and
non-dipolar total-field anomalies (section 3.3
- Robustness against non-spherical sources). On the other
hand, the results shown in section 3.4 (Robustness against
errors in the centre location) suggest that the L2-norm approach
is slightly better than the L1-norm approach if there are errors
in the vertical position of the centre of the source (Figures
7e and 7f of our manuscript). The presence of errors in the
horizontal position of the source misleads the results
obtained with both L1- and L2-approaches.

\bigskip

\underline{Referee's comment}: {\it "If there is room, I’d like to
see the total field data in the field example reduced to pole
as well, just for comparison."}

\bigskip

Sorry, we are not sure we understand this comment.
Figure 10 of our manuscript shows the field data reduced to the pole
using both the L1- and L2-norm solutions.
Is this what you mean?
