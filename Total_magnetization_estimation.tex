\begin{abstract}
We have developed a fast total-field anomaly inversion to estimate the magnetization direction of multiple sources with approximately spherical shape and known centres. Our method can be applied to interpret multiple sources with different magnetization directions. It neither requires the prior computation of any transformation like reduction to the pole nor the use of regularly spaced data on a horizontal grid. The method contains flexibility to be implemented as a linear or non-linear inverse problem, which results, respectively, in a least-squares or robust estimates of the components of the magnetization vector of the sources. Applications to synthetic data show the robustness of our method against interfering anomalies and errors in the location of the sources' centre. Besides, we show the feasibility of applying the upward continuation to interpret non-spherical sources. Applications to field data over the Goiás Alkaline Province (GAP), Brazil, show the good performance of our method in estimating geological meaningful magnetization directions. The results obtained for a region of the GAP, near from the alkaline complex of Diorama, suggest the presence of non-outcropping sources marked by strong remanent magnetization with inclination and declination close to $-70.35^{\circ}$ and $-19.81^{\circ}$, respectively. This estimated magnetization direction leads to predominantly positive reduced-to-the-pole anomalies, even for other region of the GAP, in the alkaline complex of Montes Claros de Goiás. These results show that the non-outcropping sources near from the alkaline complex of Diorama have almost the same magnetization direction of that ones in the alkaline complex of Montes Claros de Goiás, strongly suggesting that these sources have emplaced the crust almost within the same geological time interval.

\section{Introduction}

The magnetic method is one of the oldest geophysical techniques and plays an important role in mineral and oil exploration. This method underwent a great progress after the advent of magnetometers properly developed for airborne surveys. Nowadays, the combination of modern satellite positioning systems and improvements in instrumentation and platform compensation makes the aeromagnetic survey one of the most important data acquisition technique due to its wide range coverage in a relative short period of time \citep{blakely1996, nabighian-etal2005}. The main applications of the magnetic method are i) estimating the average depth of the basement relief; ii) mapping geological faults and abrupt lithological contacts; iii) defining the limits of mineral targets; iv) determining the location of geological bodies like salt domes in sediments and v) identifying geological oil and gas traps. From the physical point of view, all these geological scenarios can be associated to a magnetization distribution produced by magnetized rocks in subsurface. These magnetized rocks are the magnetic sources producing a magnetic induction that can be measured on the Earth’s surface or near from it. This magnetic induction causes local differences between the measured data and the magnetic induction predicted by global models describing the geomagnetic field. By isolating these local deviations, the interpreter can determine the magnetic induction produced by the magnetic sources making up the exploration targets.

The total field is the  most common magnetic data measured in a survey. It is defined as the Euclidean norm of the magnetic induction produced by all surrounding magnetic sources. After removing the Euclidean norm of the magnetic induction predicted by a global model describing the geomagnetic field and correcting the wide range of undesirable artefacts affecting the data, the result is a scalar quantity denominated total-field anomaly. The total-field anomaly represents the Euclidean norm of the magnetic induction produced by the magnetic sources in the subsurface. By using the total-field anomalies, the geophysicist can characterize the magnetic sources in subsurface and then better defining exploration targets \citep{telford-etal1990, blakely1996}.

Several techniques for interpreting total-field anomalies have been developed since the century XX. Among these techniques are the reduction to pole (RTP), pseudogravity transformation and analytic signal. The RTP allows transforming the total-field anomaly measured everywhere into that one that would be measured if both the magnetization of the source and the geomagnetic field were vertical \citep{baranov1957, baranov-naudy1964, silva1986}. This transformation reduces the negative lobe of the total-field anomaly and places the positive values over the magnetic source, like in gravity anomalies. However, this technique only works if the magnetization (remanent plus induced) direction of the source is known. The pseudogravity transformation uses the Poisson relation for converting an observed total-field anomaly into the gravity anomaly that would be produced by a source whose density is proportional to the magnetization intensity of the magnetic source \citep{baranov1957}. This transformation also reduces the obliquity of the total-field anomaly and requires the knowledge of the magnetization direction of the source. The analytic signal is a complex quantity that has been largely used for determining the geological contacts of the magnetic sources. The analytic signal amplitude (ASA) has a great importance in interpreting total-field anomalies produced by 2-D magnetization distributions. In this case, the ASA does not depend on the source's magnetization direction \citep{nabighian1972, nabighian1974}. In contrast, in the case of 3-D magnetization distributions, the ASA depends on the source's magnetization direction \citep{nabighian1984, li2006}.

Hence, the magnetization direction of the sources is a very important parameter for interpreting total-field anomalies. Due to this remarkable importance, several methods for determining the magnetization direction of the sources have been developed. These methods can be divided into two groups. The first one comprises methods that do not impose strong constraints on the shape of the sources. \citet{fedi-etal1994}, for example, accomplished successive RTP's in the wavenumber domain by using different tentative magnetization directions. Among this set of RTP anomalies, these authors choose that one whose amplitude of the negative part is minimum. Since this method uses a wavenumber approach, it requires that the total-field anomaly be regularly spaced in a horizontal grid with constant height to achieve the computational efficiency of the FFT. Besides, it is known that the RTP in the wavenumber domain is unstable at low latitudes and cannot be applied for interpreting total-field anomalies produced by magnetic sources having different magnetization directions. \citet{medeiros-silva1995} used the source moments up to second order derived from the multipole expansion of the magnetic potential for estimating the magnetization direction and the spatial orientation of a magnetic source. Although this method does not strongly constraint the source's shape, it presumes that the magnetic source has three orthogonal planes of symmetry intersecting each other at the centre of the source. It is also presumed that the source is far from the observation points. \citet{phillips2005} proposed a method based on the numerical evaluation of the integrals developed by \citet{helbig1963} for estimating the magnetization direction and the location of multiple magnetic sources from their first-order magnetic moments. This author stresses that the method is useful for rapid analysis of gridded magnetic data and works best for isolated and compact sources and largely fails for horizontally elongated sources. \citet{tontini-pedersen2008} extended this method for using the magnetic moments up to second order to obtain additional information about the horizontal and vertical positions of the centre of the magnetization distribution. \citet{dannemiller-li2006} extended the method proposed by \citet{roest-pilkington1993}, who tackled total-field anomalies produced by generalized 2D sources, to estimate the magnetization direction of 3D sources by using the correlation between the vertical gradient and the total gradient of the RTP anomaly obtained through a set of trial directions. These authors stressed that the method assumes that the total-field anomaly is produced by a set of 3D causative bodies with the same magnetization direction and not by multiple sources with different magnetization directions. A similar method was proposed by \citet{gerovska-etal2009} based on the comparison between the RTP anomaly and the total magnitude anomaly. \citet{lelievre-oldenburg2009} developed a very flexible method for estimating the magnetization vector distribution in complex geological scenarios. This method discretizes the subsurface of the Earth into a grid of 3D prisms and estimates the three components (in Cartesian or spherical coordinates) of the magnetization vector of each cell by imposing strong constraints on the solution to deal with the nonuniqueness. Recently, \citet{ellis-etal2012} presented a similar method to interpret magnetic data in minerals exploration surveys.

The second group of methods to estimate the magnetization direction of the sources assumes the knowledge of the shape of the source. The methods belonging to this group have led to a few published papers. \citet{bhattacharyya1966}, for example, proposed an iterative method for determining the magnetization of a uniformly magnetized rectangular prism. The performance of this method is highly dependent on the correct position of the centre and on the determination of the major and minor axes of the body. \citet{emilia-massey1974} developed an iterative method for estimating the vertical magnetization distribution of seamounts. This method approximates the seamounts by vertically juxtaposed right prisms having polygonal horizontal cross sections, which have the same magnetization direction and different magnetization intensities. \citet{parker-etal1987} also developed a method for estimating the magnetization direction of seamounts. This method was formulated as an optimization problem, named seminorm minimization, to allow estimating a magnetization distribution that is as close as possible to the uniform distribution. However, in practical applications, this constraint may yield a poor data fit. Finally, \citet{kubota-uchiyama2005} discretized the seamount volume as a grid of juxtaposed right rectangular prisms and estimated the Cartesian components of the magnetization vector of each prism.

In this work, we present a computationally efficient method for inverting the total-field anomaly produced by multiple sources with approximately spherical shape to estimate their magnetization directions. We assume sources with known centre, which can be provided by Euler deconvolution, for example. The proposed method is part of the group of methods imposing assumptions about the shape of the magnetic sources. It can be applied for interpreting multiple sources with different magnetization directions. It does not require the use of regularly spaced data on a horizontal grid and contains flexibility to be implemented in two different numerical approaches. The first one minimizes an L2-norm, resulting in a linear inverse problem to obtain a least-squares estimate. The second approach comprises the iterative minimization of an L1-norm, resulting in a non-linear inverse problem to obtain a robust estimate. Applications to synthetic data show the robustness of our method against interfering anomalies and errors in the location of the sources centre. Additionally, we show how the upward continuation can be used to make possible the application of our method to interpret non-spherical sources. Applications to field data over the Goiás Alkaline Province (GAP), Brazil, show the good performance of the proposed method in estimating geological meaningful magnetization directions. The obtained results over a region of the GAP, near from the alkaline complex of Diorama, suggest the presence of non-outcropping sources with strong remanent magnetization, corroborating previous works. The estimated inclinations and declinations are close to $-70.35^{\circ}$ and $-19.81^{\circ}$, respectively.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Parameterization and Forward Problem}

Let $\vec{\Delta T}^{o}$ be the observed data vector, whose $i$th element $\Delta T^{o}_{i}$, $i = 1, ..., N$, is the total-field anomaly measured at the position $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$ (black dots in Fig. \ref{fig:geometric-aspects}). In this Cartesian coordinate system, $x$ points to the geographic north, $y$ points to east and $z$ points downward. In general, the total-field anomaly is produced by a magnetized  susceptibility distribution which is anomalous with respect to the mean susceptibility of the crust. Mathematically, $\Delta T^{o}_{i}$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
\Delta T^{o}_{i} = \Vert \vec{T}_i \Vert - \Vert \vec{F}_i \Vert \: ,
\label{eq:tfanomaly-i}
\end{equation}
where $\Vert \Vert$ indicates the Euclidean norm, $\vec{F}_i$ is the geomagnetic field vector and $\vec{T}_i$ is the total-field vector, both at $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$. The total-field vector can be represented by the sum
\begin{equation}
\vec{T}_i = \vec{F}_i + \vec{B}_i \: ,
\label{eq:tfvector-i}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{B}_i$ is the total magnetic induction vector produced by all magnetic sources (magnetized anomalous susceptibility distribution) at the position $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$ \citep{blakely1996, langel-hinze1998}.

For local or regional scale magnetic studies, it is very common to consider that (i) the geomagnetic Field $\vec{F}_i$ (Eq. \ref{eq:tfanomaly-i}) is a constant vector $\vec{F}_{0}$ throughout the study area and (ii) that $\Vert \vec{F}_{0} \Vert \gg \Vert \vec{B}_{i} \Vert$, $i = 1, ..., N$ \citep{telford-etal1990, blakely1996}. The second assumption is equivalent to say that the total magnetic induction $\vec{B}_i$ (Eq. \ref{eq:tfanomaly-i}) is a small perturbation of the geomagnetic field $\vec{F}_i$ throughout the study area. These two assumptions make possible to approximate the Euclidean norm of the total-field vector $\vec{T}_i$ (Eq. \ref{eq:tfanomaly-i}) by a first-order Taylor's expansion as follows
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{cl}
\Vert \vec{T}_{i} \Vert & 
\approx \Vert \vec{F}_{0} + \vec{B}_{i} \Vert \\
\: &
\approx \Vert \vec{F}_{0} \Vert + \hat{\vec{F}}^{\intercal}\vec{B}_{i} \: ,
\end{array}
\label{eq:total-field-app}
\end{equation}
where the superscript $\intercal$ indicates transposition and
\begin{equation}
\hat{\vec{F}} = \dfrac{\vec{F}_{0}}{\Vert \vec{F}_{0} \Vert}
\label{eq:unit-vector}
\end{equation}
is a unit vector (with the same direction of the geomagnetic field $\vec{F}_i$) representing the gradient of the function $\Vert \vec{T}_{i} \Vert$ with respect to the components of the vector $\vec{T}_{i}$ \citep{blakely1996}. By introducing this first-order Taylor's expansion into the total-field anomaly (Eq. \ref{eq:tfanomaly-i}), we obtain the well-known approximated total-field anomaly given by
\begin{equation}
\Delta T_{i} \approx \hat{\vec{F}}^{\intercal}\vec{B}_{i} \: , \qquad i = 1, ..., N \: .
\label{eq:approx-tfanomaly-i}
\end{equation}

Let's consider that the magnetic sources can be represented by a set of $L$ uniformly magnetized spheres. In this case, the total magnetic induction $\vec{B}_i$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\vec{B}_i = \sum_{j = 1}^{L} \vec{b}_{i}^{j} \: , \qquad i = 1, ..., N \: ,
\label{eq:total-induction-i}
\end{equation}
being $\vec{b}^{j}_{i}$ the magnetic induction produced, at the position $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$, by the $j$th sphere, $j = 1, ..., L$, with radius $R_ {j}$ (dashed straight lines in Fig. \ref{fig:geometric-aspects}), centre at $(xc_{j}, yc_{j}, zc_{j})$ (grey dots in Fig. \ref{fig:geometric-aspects}) and magnetization vector $\vec{m}^{j}$ given by
\begin{equation}
\vec{m}^{j} =
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
mx_{j} \\
my_{j} \\
mz_{j}
\end{array}
\right]_ {3 \times 1} \: .
\label{eq:mag-vector-j}
\end{equation}
The magnetic induction $\vec{b}^{j}_{i}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:total-induction-i}) can be written as
\begin{equation}
\vec{b}^{j}_{i} = C_{m} \: \mathbf{M}_{i}^{j} \: 
                  \dfrac{4}{3} \pi R_{j}^{3} \:
                  \vec{m}^{j} \: ,
\label{eq:j-induction-i}
\end{equation}
where $C_{m}$ is a constant given by $\mu_{0} / {4 \pi}=10^{-7}$ H/m, $\mu_{0}$ is the vacuum permeability and $\mathbf{M}_{i}^{j}$ is the matrix 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{M}^{j}_{i} =
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\left( \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x \partial x} \frac{1}{r_{j}} \right) &
\left( \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x \partial y} \frac{1}{r_{j}} \right) &
\left( \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x \partial z} \frac{1}{r_{j}} \right) \\
\left( \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x \partial y} \frac{1}{r_{j}} \right) &
\left( \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y \partial y} \frac{1}{r_{j}} \right) &
\left( \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y \partial z} \frac{1}{r_{j}} \right) \\
\left( \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x \partial z} \frac{1}{r_{j}} \right) &
\left( \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y \partial z} \frac{1}{r_{j}} \right) &
\left( \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial z \partial z} \frac{1}{r_{j}} \right)
\end{array}
\right]_{3 \times 3} \: ,
\label{eq:matrix-Mij}
\end{equation}
whose elements are the second derivatives, evaluated at the position $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$, of the function
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{1}{r_{j}} \equiv 
\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{(x - xc_{j})^{2} + 
				(y - yc_{j})^{2} +
				(z - zc_{j})^{2}}}
\label{eq:1/rj}
\end{equation}
with respect to the variables $x$, $y$ and $z$. By substituting the magnetic induction $\vec{b}^{j}_{i}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:j-induction-i}) into the total magnetic induction vector $\vec{B}_i$ (Eq. \ref{eq:total-induction-i}) and using the approximated total-field anomaly (Eq. \ref{eq:approx-tfanomaly-i}) we obtain the predicted total-field anomaly $d_{i}$ produced by the set of $L$ spheres at the position $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$ as follows
\begin{equation}
d_{i} = \hat{\vec{F}}^{\intercal} \sum_{j = 1}^{L} \mathbf{M}_{i}^{j} \: \vec{h}^{j} \: ,
\label{eq:predicted-i}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\vec{h}^{j} = C_{m} \: \dfrac{4}{3} \pi R_{j}^{3} \: \vec{m}^{j} \: ,
\qquad j = 1, ..., L \: .
\label{eq:hj}
\end{equation}
This equation shows that each vector $\vec{h}^{j}$ has the same direction of the magnetization vector $\vec{m}^{j}$, $j = 1, ..., L$ (Eq. \ref{eq:mag-vector-j}). In Cartesian coordinates, we have $\vec{h}^{j} = \left[hx_{j} \quad hy_{j} \quad hz_{j}\right]^{\intercal}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:spherical-coordinates}), where $h\alpha_{j} = C_{m} \: \frac{4}{3} \pi R_{j}^{3} \: m\alpha_{j}$, $\alpha = x, y, z$, $j = 1, ..., L$, and $m\alpha_{j}$, $\alpha = x, y, z$,  are the elements of the magnetization vector $\vec{m}^{j}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:mag-vector-j}). Equation (\ref{eq:predicted-i}) can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
d_{i}(\vec{h}) = \vec{a}_{i}^{\intercal} \vec{h} \: ,
\label{eq:aiTh}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\vec{h} = 
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
\vec{h}^{1} \\
\vdots \\
\vec{h}^{L}
\end{array}
\right]_{3L \times 1} \: ,
\label{eq:h}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\vec{a}_{i} = 
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
\mathbf{M}_{i}^{1} \: \hat{\vec{F}} \\
\vdots \\
\mathbf{M}_{i}^{L} \: \hat{\vec{F}}
\end{array}
\right]_{3L \times 1} \: .
\label{eq:ai}
\end{equation}
Note that, in Eq. (\ref{eq:aiTh}), the predicted total-field anomaly $d_{i}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:predicted-i}) is represented by $d_{i}(\vec{h})$ in order to express its dependence on the parameter vector $\vec{h}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:h}). The linear relationship given by Eq. (\ref{eq:aiTh}) can be written in matrix notation as
\begin{equation}
\vec{d}(\vec{h}) = \mathbf{A} \: \vec{h} \: ,
\label{eq:predicted-data-vector}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{d}(\vec{h})$ is the $N$-dimensional predicted data vector, whose $i$th element is $d_{i}(\vec{h})$ (Eq. \ref{eq:aiTh}), and $\mathbf{A}$ is a $N \times 3L$ matrix that can be partitioned as
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A} =
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
\vec{a}_{1}^{\intercal} \\
\vdots \\
\vec{a}_{N}^{\intercal}
\end{array}
\right]_{N \times 3L} \: ,
\label{eq:sensibility-matrix}
\end{equation}
being $\vec{a}_{i}$, $i = 1, ..., N$, the $3L$-dimensional vector defined in Eq. (\ref{eq:ai}).

\subsection{Inverse Problem}

We assume that the magnetic sources giving rise to the observed data $\vec{\Delta T}^{o}$ can be approximated by a set of $L$  uniformly magnetized spheres with known coordinates $(xc_{j}, yc_{j}, zc_{j})$, $j = 1, ..., L$, of their centres. We also assume that the direction of the constant geomagnetic field $\vec{F}_{0}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:total-field-app}) is known. Under these hypotheses, we formulate a linear inverse problem of estimating the parameter vector $\vec{h}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:h}) from $\vec{\Delta T}^{o}$. The problem of estimating a parameter vector $\vec{h}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:h}) containing the magnetization vectors $\vec{m}^{j}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:mag-vector-j}), $j = 1, ..., L$, of the $L$ spheres can be done by minimizing the goal function
\begin{equation}
\Psi(\vec{h}) = \frac{1}{N}[\vec{\Delta T}^{o} - \vec{d}(\vec{h})]^{\intercal}[\vec{\Delta T}^{o} - \vec{d}(\vec{h})] \: .
\label{eq:goal-function-L2}
\end{equation}
Differentiating Eq. (\ref{eq:goal-function-L2}) with respect to $\vec{h}$ and equating the result to the null vector, we obtain the normal equation for the least-squares estimate $\hat{\vec{h}}$, i. e.,
\begin{equation}
(\mathbf{A}^{\intercal}\mathbf{A}) \: \hat{\vec{h}} = \mathbf{A}^{\intercal} \: \vec{\Delta T}^{o} \: .
\label{eq:h_hat}
\end{equation}
The least-squares estimate $\hat{\vec{h}}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:h_hat}) minimizes the goal function (Eq. \ref{eq:goal-function-L2}) and produces the predicted data $\vec{d}(\hat{\vec{h}})$ (Eq. \ref{eq:predicted-data-vector}) as near as possible from the observed data $\vec{\Delta T}^{o}$, in the L2-norm sense \citep{bard1973, twomey1977, menke1989, aster-etal2005}.

The least-squares estimate $\hat{\vec{h}}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:h_hat}) is very sensitive to outliers in the observed data. In some cases, if the outliers are not properly removed from the observed data, the estimated parameters can be seriously misleading. When working with field data, the outliers can be caused by interfering magnetic sources or cultural noise, for example. To counteract this problem automatically, we can use a robust scheme for minimizing the goal function
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(\vec{h}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} 
\vert \Delta T^{o}_{i} - d_{i}(\vec{h}) \vert \: .
\label{eq:goal-function-L1}
\end{equation}
Different from Eq. (\ref{eq:goal-function-L2}), the parameter vector $\vec{h}$ minimizing the Eq. (\ref{eq:goal-function-L1}) cannot be obtained by solving a linear system. One practical way is the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares algorithm \citep{scales_1988, aster-etal2005}. In this algorithm, at each iteration $k$, the following linear system is solved:
\begin{equation}
\left( \mathbf{A}^{\intercal} \mathbf{R}^{k} \mathbf{A} \right) \tilde{\vec{h}}^{k+1} =
\mathbf{A}^{\intercal} \mathbf{R}^{k} \vec{\Delta T}^{o} \: ,
\label{eq:iteration-L1}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{R}^{k}$ is a diagonal $N \times N$ matrix whose $i$th element $r_{i}^{k}$, $i = 1, ..., N$, is given by
\begin{equation}
r_{i}^{k} = \dfrac{1}{\vert \Delta T^{o}_{i} - d_{i}(\tilde{\vec{h}}^{k}) + \epsilon \vert} \: ,
\label{eq:ri}
\end{equation}
being $\epsilon$ a small positive number used to prevent singularities. This iterative process begins (iteration $k = 0$) with the least-squares estimate $\tilde{\vec{h}}^{0} = \hat{\vec{h}}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:h_hat}). With this initial approximation $\tilde{\vec{h}}^{0}$, we calculate the matrix $\mathbf{R}^{0}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:ri}). By using the matrix $\mathbf{R}^{0}$, we solve the linear system given by Eq. (\ref{eq:iteration-L1}) for obtaining the estimate $\tilde{\vec{h}}^{1}$. By using the updated estimate $\tilde{\vec{h}}^{1}$, we calculate the matrix $\mathbf{R}^{1}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:ri}), solve the linear system (Eq. \ref{eq:iteration-L1}) for obtaining the updated estimate $\tilde{\vec{h}}^{2}$ and so on. After some iterations, this iterative procedure converges to the estimate $\tilde{\vec{h}}$, which is named robust estimate and is an approximation of the parameter vector minimizing the function $\Gamma(\vec{h})$ (Eq. \ref{eq:goal-function-L1}).

Both $\hat{\vec{h}}$ (least-squares estimate) and $\tilde{\vec{h}}$ (robust estimate) are estimates of the parameter vector $\vec{h}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:h}), which is represented as a function of the vectors $\vec{h}^{j}$, $j = 1, ..., L$ (Eq. \ref{eq:hj}) and the magnetization vectors $\vec{m}^{j}$, $j = 1, ..., L$ (Eq. \ref{eq:mag-vector-j}). The magnetization vectors are represented in Cartesian coordinates, however they are commonly represented in terms of its intensity, declination and inclination. Therefore, for convenience, we will represent the vectors $\vec{h}^{j}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:hj}) in spherical coordinates as follows
\begin{equation}
\vec{h}^{j} = Q_{j} \:
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
\cos I_{j} \: \cos D_{j} \\
\cos I_{j} \: \sin D_{j} \\
\sin I_{j}
\end{array}
\right]_{3 \times 1} \: ,
\label{eq:hj-spheric}
\end{equation}
where the intensity $Q_{j}$, declination $D_{j}$ and inclination $I_{j}$ are given as functions of the elements $hx_{j}$, $hy_{j}$ and $hz_{j}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:spherical-coordinates}) of $\vec{h}^{j}$, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
Q_{j} = \sqrt{hx_{j}^{2} + hy_{j}^{2} + hz_{j}^{2}} \quad ,
\label{eq:Qj}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
D_{j} = \arctan \left( \dfrac{hy_{j}}{hx_{j}} \right) \quad ,
\label{eq:Dj}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
I_{j} = \arctan \left( \dfrac{hz_{j}}{\sqrt{hx_{j}^{2} + hy_{j}^{2}}} \right) \quad .
\label{eq:Ij}
\end{equation}

Note that, according to Eq. (\ref{eq:hj}), the declinations $D_{j}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:Dj}) and inclinations $I_{j}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:Ij}), $j = 1, ..., L$, are equal to that ones of the magnetization vectors $\vec{m}^{j}$, $j = 1, ..., L$ (Eq. \ref{eq:mag-vector-j}). After obtaining the least-squares estimate $\hat{\vec{h}}$ or the robust estimate $\tilde{\vec{h}}$, we calculate the declinations $\hat{D}_{j}$ or $\tilde{D}_{j}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:Dj}) and inclinations $\hat{I}_{j}$ or $\tilde{I}_{j}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:Ij}), $j = 1, ..., L$, of the total magnetization vector of all spheres. We use a caret ($^\wedge$) and a tilde ($^\sim$) to distinguish estimates of the declinations and inclinations which are computed by using, respectively, the least-square estimate $\hat{\vec{h}}$ and the robust estimate $\tilde{\vec{h}}$. 

\subsection{Uncertainty of the estimated parameters}

In a magnetic survey, the measurements are always affected by noise due to the wide range of experimental errors and inaccuracies that happens in a geophysical survey. The noise in the observed data $\vec{\Delta T}^{o}$ affects the estimated parameter vector, independently of the used method. To quantify this effect on the estimated parameters, we can use the propagation of covariance \citep{bard1973, aster-etal2005}. By presuming that the errors of all observed data ${\Delta T}^{o}_{i}$, $i = 1, ..., N$, are independent and of equal variance $\sigma^{2}$, we obtain the data covariance matrix $\mathbf{D} = \sigma^{2} \: \mathbf{I}$, where $\mathbf{I}$ is the $N \times N$ identity matrix. The parameter covariance matrix $\hat{\mathbf{C}}$ of the least-squares estimate $\hat{\vec{h}}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:h_hat}) is given by
\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{C}} = \hat{\mathbf{H}} \: \mathbf{D} \: \hat{\mathbf{H}}^{\intercal} \: ,
\label{eq:cov-h-hat}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{H}} = \left( \mathbf{A}^{\intercal}\mathbf{A} \right)^{-1} \mathbf{A}^{\intercal} \: .
\label{eq:H-h-hat}
\end{equation}
Similarly, the parameter covariance matrix $\tilde{\mathbf{C}}$ of the robust estimate $\tilde{\vec{h}}$ (Eqs. \ref{eq:iteration-L1} and \ref{eq:ri}) can be given by
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{C}} = \tilde{\mathbf{H}} \: \mathbf{D} \: 
\tilde{\mathbf{H}}^{\intercal} \: ,
\label{eq:cov-h-tilde}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{H}} = \left( \mathbf{A}^{\intercal} \mathbf{R}^{k} \mathbf{A} \right)^{-1}
\mathbf{A}^{\intercal} \mathbf{R}^{k} \: ,
\label{eq:H-h-tilde}
\end{equation}
and the matrix $\mathbf{R}^{k}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:iteration-L1}) is the last one calculated in the iterative process for estimating $\tilde{\vec{h}}$ \citep{bard1973, aster-etal2005}.

The diagonal of the parameter covariance matrices $\hat{\mathbf{C}}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:cov-h-hat}) and $\tilde{\mathbf{C}}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:cov-h-tilde}) contains the variances of the elements of the estimates $\hat{\vec{h}}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:h_hat}) and $\tilde{\vec{h}}$ (Eqs. \ref{eq:iteration-L1} and \ref{eq:ri}), respectively. Let $\vec{v}$ be a $3L$-dimensional vector whose element $v_{j}$, $j = 1, ..., 3L$, represents the $j$th element of the diagonal of the covariance matrix $\hat{\mathbf{C}}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:cov-h-hat}) or $\tilde{\mathbf{C}}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:cov-h-tilde}). This vector can be represented by
\begin{equation}
\vec{v} = 
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\vec{v}^{1} \\
\vdots \\
\vec{v}^{L}
\end{array}
\right]_{3L \times 1} \: ,
\label{eq:v}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\vec{v}^{j} = 
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\left( \sigma x_{j} \right)^{2} \\
\left( \sigma y_{j} \right)^{2} \\
\left( \sigma z_{j} \right)^{2}
\end{array}
\right]_{3 \times 1} \: ,
\label{eq:vj}
\end{equation}
and ${\sigma \alpha}_{j}$, $\alpha = x, y, z$, $j = 1, ..., L$, are the uncertainties of the components ${h \alpha}_{j}$, $\alpha = x, y, z$, $j = 1, ..., L$, of the vectors $\vec{h}^{j}$, $j = 1, ..., L$ (Eq. \ref{eq:hj}), forming the estimated parameter vector $\hat{\vec{h}}$ or $\tilde{\vec{h}}$. The uncertainties of the intensity $Q_{j}$, declination $D_{j}$ and inclination $I_{j}$ can be given as functions of the uncertainties ${\sigma \alpha}_{j}$, $\alpha = x, y, z$, $j = 1, ..., L$ (Eq. \ref{eq:vj}). To do it, we use the propagation of uncertainties \citep{fornasini2008} and presume that the components ${h \alpha}_{j}$, $\alpha = x, y, z$, $j = 1, ..., L$, of the vector $\vec{h}^{j}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:hj}) are statistically independent. From this assumption, the uncertainties $\sigma_{Qj}$, $\sigma_{Dj}$ and $\sigma_{Ij}$ of the intensity $Q_{j}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:Qj}), declination $D_{j}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:Dj}) and inclination $I_{j}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:Ij}), respectively, are given by
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{Qj} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{\partial Q_{j}}{\partial hx_{j}} \: \sigma x_{j} \right)^{2} +
                    \left( \frac{\partial Q_{j}}{\partial hy_{j}} \: \sigma y_{j} \right)^{2} +
                    \left( \frac{\partial Q_{j}}{\partial hz_{j}} \: \sigma z_{j} \right)^{2}} \: ,
\label{eq:sigmaQj}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{Dj} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{\partial D_{j}}{\partial hx_{j}} \: \sigma x_{j} \right)^{2} +
                    \left( \frac{\partial D_{j}}{\partial hy_{j}} \: \sigma y_{j} \right)^{2}}
\label{eq:sigmaDj}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{Ij} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{\partial I_{j}}{\partial hx_{j}} \: \sigma x_{j} \right)^{2} +
                    \left( \frac{\partial I_{j}}{\partial hy_{j}} \: \sigma y_{j} \right)^{2} +
                    \left( \frac{\partial I_{j}}{\partial hz_{j}} \: \sigma z_{j} \right)^{2}} \: .
\label{eq:sigmaIj}
\end{equation}
The first-order derivatives shown in Eqs. (\ref{eq:sigmaQj}), (\ref{eq:sigmaDj}) and (\ref{eq:sigmaIj}) are given by
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\partial Q_{j}}{\partial h \alpha_{j}} = \dfrac{h \alpha_{j}}{Q_{j}} \: , \quad \alpha = x, y, z \: ,
\label{eq:dQj-dhalphaj}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial D_{j}}{\partial hx_{j}} = \dfrac{- hy_{j}}{ \left( hx_{j} \right)^{2} + \left( hy_{j} \right)^{2}} \: ,
\label{eq:dDj-dhxj}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial D_{j}}{\partial hy_{j}} = \dfrac{ hx_{j} }{ \left( hx_{j} \right)^{2} + \left( hy_{j} \right)^{2}} \: ,
\label{eq:dDj-dhyj}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial I_{j}}{\partial h \alpha_{j}} = \dfrac{-h \alpha_{j} hz_{j}}{Q_{j}^{2} \sqrt{\left( hx_{j} \right)^{2} + \left( hy_{j} \right)^{2}}} \: , \quad \alpha = x, y \: ,
\label{eq:dIj-dhalphaj}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial I_{j}}{\partial hz_{j}} = \dfrac{ \sqrt{\left( hx_{j} \right)^{2} + \left( hy_{j} \right)^{2}} }{Q_{j}^{2}} \: .
\label{eq:dIj-dhzj}
\end{equation}
We use a caret ($^{\wedge}$) and a tilde ($^{\sim}$) to distinguish the uncertainties ($\hat{\sigma}$ and $\tilde{\sigma}$) computed by using, respectively, the least-squares $\hat{\vec{h}}$ and the robust $\tilde{\vec{h}}$ estimates.

\section{Application to synthetic data}

\subsection{Validation test}

Figure \ref{fig:synt1-data}a shows the synthetic noise-corrupted total-field anomaly produced by two uniformly magnetized bodies embedded in nonmagnetic host rocks. The first one is a sphere with radius $1000$ m, centre at $xc$ = $3000$ m, $yc$ = $3000$ m, $zc$ = $1000$ m and magnetization vector with intensity $6$ A/m, declination $10^{\circ}$ and inclination $20^{\circ}$. The second synthetic body is a rectangular prism with horizontal and vertical dimensions equal to $1000$ m, depth of the top at $200$ m, centre at $xc$ = $7000$ m, $yc$ = $7000$ m, $zc$ = $700$ m and magnetization vector with intensity $6$ A/m, declination $40^{\circ}$ and inclination $30^{\circ}$. We simulated a constant geomagnetic field $\vec{F}^{o}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:total-field-app}) with declination $15^{\circ}$ and inclination $10^{\circ}$. The total field anomaly produced by these synthetic bodies (indicated by A and B in Fig. \ref{eq:total-field-app}) was calculated at $N$ = $10000$ irregularly spaced points $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$, $i = 1, ..., N$, on the plane with constant vertical coordinate z = $-150$ m, extending from $0$ m to $10000$ m in both x- and y-directions. The pseudorandom Gaussian noise added has a zero mean and a standard deviation of $5$ nT. 

By assigning the correct positions of the centres of the simulated bodies, we invert this noise-corrupted total-field anomaly (Fig. \ref{fig:synt1-data}a) to obtain the least-squares estimate $\hat{\vec{h}}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:h_hat}) and robust estimate $\tilde{\vec{h}}$ (Eqs. \ref{eq:iteration-L1} and \ref{eq:ri}). Next, we use these estimates to calculate the estimated declinations and inclinations (Eqs. \ref{eq:Dj} and \ref{eq:Ij}). Finally, we calculate the uncertainties using the propagation of covariance (Eqs. \ref{eq:cov-h-hat}-\ref{eq:H-h-tilde}) and assuming that the standard deviation of the errors is equal to the true one ($\sigma = 5$ nT). The results (Table \ref{tab:synt1-without-inter-anomaly}) show that our method is able to retrieve the magnetization directions of the true sources by using either the least-squares or robust estimate. Even in the case of the prism that violates the premise assumed by our method that the bodies can be approximated by spheres,  the estimates are very close to the true ones with a small uncertainties. We can attribute this good performance of our method to three factors: i) the absence of interfering signals produced, for example, by multiple magnetic sources; ii) the simulated prism is a cube that seems a sphere-like body; and iii) the use of the  correct locations of the centres of the simulated bodies. The following tests will show how these factors affect the results obtained by using the least-squares and robust estimates.

\subsection{Robustness against interfering anomalies}

Figure \ref{fig:synt1-data}b shows the noise-corrupted total-field anomaly shown in Fig. \ref{fig:synt1-data}a contaminated with interfering anomalies. These interfering anomalies are characterized by mid-wavelength components which mostly affect the positive signals of the original total-field anomaly (Fig. \ref{fig:synt1-data}a), resulting in non-dipolar total-field anomalies (Fig. \ref{fig:synt1-data}b). Notice that this test violates the premise assumed by our method that the total-field anomalies are caused by dipolar bodies (spheres). Although these interfering anomalies are different from random Gaussian noise or outliers marked as spurious errors dominated by short-wavelength spectral contents, they can be also seen as a noise which will affect the results obtained with our method.

We repeated the numerical test presented in the previous section (Sect. Validation test), but using the contaminated total-field anomaly shown in Fig. \ref{fig:synt1-data}b. The results are shown in Table \ref{tab:synt1-with-inter-anomaly}. As we can see, the results obtained with the least-squares estimate are very affected by the interfering anomalies if compared with that ones obtained by using the robust estimate. By comparing the true values of inclination $I$ and declination $D$ with that ones obtained with the least-squares estimate, the differences reach approximately $14^{\circ}$ in declination and $9^{\circ}$ in inclination. On the other hand, the differences between the results obtained with the robust estimate and the true values reach only $2^{\circ}$ in declination and $3^{\circ}$ in inclination. These results suggest that the least-squares estimate is more sensitive to interfering anomalies than the robust estimate.

\subsection{Robustness against non-spherical sources}

In the previous subsections, we applied our method to estimate the magnetization direction of a rectangular prism whose total-field anomaly is indicated by $\textbf{B}$ in Fig. \ref{fig:synt1-data}. This total-field anomaly is similar to one that would be produced by a sphere. Two factors contribute to this: (i) the prism has all edges equal to $1000$ m and (ii) the distance between its top depth and the plane surface on which the data were calculated is $350$ m. In this subsection, we analyse the effect of these two factors on the results obtained with our method. To do it, we applied our method to estimate the magnetization direction of 11 rectangular prisms with different side lengths Lx, Ly and Lz (Fig. \ref{fig:robust-shape-methodology}a) and top at $10$ m deep. All prisms have uniform magnetization with intensity, declination and inclination equal to $6$ A/m, $-40^{\circ}$ and $30^{\circ}$, respectively, centre at $xc = 0$ m, $yc = 0$ m and $zc = 510$ m and side lengths Lx = Lz = $1000$ m. For simplicity, we adopted dimensionless quantities by normalizing all coordinates and lengths by the numerical value of Lz ($1000$ m), implying that Lx = Lz = $1.0$. The only difference between these $11$ prisms is the side length Ly, which varies regularly from $0.2$ to $1.8$. Figure \ref{fig:robust-shape-methodology}b shows the x-y cross-section of three different rectangular prisms with Ly equal to $0.2$, $1.0$ and $1.8$. We calculated the noise-corrupted total-field anomalies produced by all prisms on horizontal planes with constant z equal to $0.0$, $-0.3$ and $-0.6$ (dashed lines in Fig. \ref{fig:robust-shape-methodology}b), resulting in $33$ synthetic data sets. All data are calculated at $N = 3000$ points irregularly spaced over an area extending from $-5$ to $5$ along the x- and y-directions. The pseudo-random Gaussian noise added has a zero mean and a standard deviation of $5$ nT. The simulated constant geomagnetic field $\vec{F}_{0}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:total-field-app}) has declination $-15^{\circ}$ and inclination $-10^{\circ}$.

Figures \ref{fig:robust-shape-data}a, b and c show that total-field anomalies calculated near from the sources are very different to that ones produced by spherical bodies (dipolar sources) and exhibit strongly non-dipolar features. These non-dipolar features are attenuated if the data are calculated far from the sources (Figs. \ref{fig:robust-shape-data}g, h and i), showing the well known property that the magnetic field produced by a non-dipolar source tends to the field produced by a dipolar source at great distances. This attenuation is more noticeable for sources presenting symmetry around three orthogonal axis. This higher attenuation for symmetrical sources can be seen by comparing the Figs. \ref{fig:robust-shape-data}b, e and h, which show anomalies produced by a cube with Lx = Ly = Lz = $1.0$, with Figs. \ref{fig:robust-shape-data}a, c, d, f, g and i, which show anomalies produced by other rectangular prisms. For example, on the plane z = $-0.3$, the total-field anomaly produced by the cube (Fig. \ref{fig:robust-shape-data}h) displays  approximately a dipolar feature while the total-field anomalies produced by the other prisms (Figs. \ref{fig:robust-shape-data}d and f) exhibit non-dipolar features.

We applied our method to interpret these 33 data sets and the results are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:robust-shape-results}. In all these applications, we presume the correct location of the centre of the sources. Figure \ref{fig:robust-shape-results} shows that the robust estimates (red dots) are much better than the least-squares estimates (blue dots). This better performance is noteworthy for the estimated declinations obtained by inverting the total-field anomalies near from the sources (red dots in Fig. \ref{fig:robust-shape-results}a). The least-squares estimates (blue dots in Figs. \ref{fig:robust-shape-results}a and b) seem to be more sensitive to the strong non-dipolar total-field anomalies (e.g., Figs. \ref{fig:robust-shape-data}a-c). By inverting the total-field anomalies far the sources (e.g., Figs. \ref{fig:robust-shape-data}d-i), the least-squares estimates are approximately similar to the robust estimates (Figs. \ref{fig:robust-shape-results}c-f).

The greater the distance between the sources and the data, the greater the attenuation of the non-dipolar features; and thus the smaller the difference between the least-squares and robust estimates. In this case, a good practice when applying our method is to perform an upward continuation of the total-field anomaly to be inverted.

\subsection{Robustness against errors in the centre location}

In all previous tests with synthetic data, we presume the correct location of the centre of the sources. However, in real world scenarios, the position of the sources cannot be obtained directly and have to be estimated. This estimation can be done, for example, by using the Euler deconvolution technique \citet{thompson1982, reid-etal1990}. This is a classical technique in potential field methods and is widely used for estimating the 3D position of magnetic sources \citep{reid-etal2014, uieda-etal2014}. Like all numerical techniques, the estimates obtained via Euler deconvolution contain errors that will affect the results obtained with our method. So, in this subsection, we analyse how the errors in the coordinates of the centre of the source affect the results obtained with our method.

We simulated a uniformly magnetized sphere (not shown) with centre at $xc = 5000$ m, $yc = 5000$ m and $zc = 1000$ m, radius $R = 1000$ m and magnetization vector with intensity $8.0$ A/m, declination $-13^{\circ}$ and inclination $-40^{\circ}$. The simulated constant geomagnetic field $\vec{F}_{0}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:total-field-app}) has declination $-13^{\circ}$ and inclination $-9.5^{\circ}$. The noise-corrupted total-field anomaly (not shown) produced by this sphere is calculated at $N = 2601$ points equally spaced on a plane with constant z = $-150$ m, extending from $0$ m to $10000$ m along both the x- and y-axis. The pseudo-random Gaussian noise added has null mean and standard deviation equal to $2$ nT. 

We applied our method to this synthetic data for estimating the magnetization direction of the simulated spherical body. This application was done by presuming different locations of the centre of the source along three orthogonal straight lines which are parallel to the x-, y- and z-axis and cross the centre of the simulated spherical body. Along each line, we varied the centre of the source at $21$ points regularly spaced in a range of $2000$ m. The results obtained along the  x-, y- and z-axis are shown in Figs. \ref{fig:robust-center-results}a-b, c-d and e-f, respectively.

We can clearly see that the wrong choice of the x- and y-coordinates of the center of the source leads to poor estimates of the magnetization direction (declinations and inclinations in Figs. \ref{fig:robust-center-results}a-d) when compared with the true magnetization vector (continuous black lines in Fig. \ref{fig:robust-center-results}). On the other hand, the estimated declinations and inclinations are less sensitive to the wrong choice of the z-coordinate of the centre of the source (Figs. \ref{fig:robust-center-results}e-f), especially the ones obtained by the least-squares estimate. These results show that our method is more sensitive to uncertainties in the prior information about location of the centre of the source along the horizontal directions than in the vertical direction. Fortunately, the sensitivity of Euler deconvolution to estimate the 3D position of magnetic sources works in opposite direction. As shown by \citet{silva-barbosa2003} and \citet{melo-etal2013}, the estimates of the source horizontal positions in Euler deconvolution are very accurate while the depth estimates may fail. This characteristic makes Euler deconvolution a suitable technique for providing the centre of the source to be used by our method as prior information to form the matrix given in Eq. (\ref{eq:sensibility-matrix}).

\section{Application to field data}

In Goiás state, central region of Brazil, there are occurrences of Cretaceous alkaline rocks along a lineament NW-SE that have been studied since the 60's. In a broad regional scale study, \citet{almeida1983} denominated these occurrences as Rio Verde-Iporá Igneous Province. Posteriorly, \citet{sgarbi2002} grouped the Rio Verde - Iporá Igneous Province and the Alto Paranaíba Igneous Province (between the Goiás and Minas Gerais states, Fig. \ref{fig:geology-study-area}) into the Minas - Goiás Alkaline Province. According to these authors, the Minas-Goiás Alkaline Province would be divided into four sub-provinces: Mata da Corda, Alto do Paranaíba, Iporá and Santo Antônio da Barra. In the same year, \citet{junqueira-brod2002} returned to the concept of two distinct provinces. These authors maintained the old name Alto Paranaíba Igneous Province for designating the alkaline rocks located between the Goiás and Minas Gerais states and denominated the alkaline rocks near from Rio Verde and Iporá cities (in the Goiás state) as Goiás Alkaline Province (GAP). Here, we use this nomenclature proposed by \citet{junqueira-brod2002}.

The GAP is formed by mafic to ultramafic alkaline rocks presenting a wide variety of petrographic types \citep{almeida1983, junqueira-brod2005, carlson-etal2007, marangoni-mantovani2013}. Among the main alkaline complexes in the north portion of GAP are the Montes Claros de Goiás, Diorama, Córrego dos Bois, Morro do Macaco and Fazenda Buriti (Fig. \ref{fig:geology-study-area}). These alkaline intrusions are surrounded by Precambrian basement and the Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks of the Paraná basin. In 2004, this region was flown by an aeromagnetic survey at an approximately constant height of $100$ m from the terrain (approximately constant normal height of $500$ m). This survey has a flight pattern with N-S lines spaced from $500$ m and E-W tie-lines spaced from $5000$ m. Along each line, the data are spaced from approximately $8$ m. The data were corrected for diurnal variation and subtracted from the geomagnetic field modelled by using the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) evaluated at the 2004.62 epoch, with declination $-18.5^{\circ}$ and inclination $-19.5^{\circ}$. This region is characterized by intense total-field anomalies (with notable remnant magnetization) that are generally associated to the alkaline rocks of GAP \citep{dutra-marangoni2009, dutra-etal2012, marangoni-mantovani2013}.

We applied our method to interpret the data located in the area delimited by the red rectangle shown in Fig. \ref{fig:geology-study-area}, near from the alkaline complex of Diorama. The data are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:TFA-Diorama}. To attenuate the non-dipolar effects present in the data, we applied the Polynomial Equivalent Layer \citep{oliveirajr-etal2013} to continue the anomaly upward to a constant normal height of $1000$ m in a regularly spaced grid. By inverting the upward continued data (not shown), we estimated the centre of the body by applying the Euler deconvolution and obtained its magnetization direction by using least-squares and robust estimates. We obtained the estimated inclinations $\hat{I} = -69.25595^{\circ} \pm 0.00013^{\circ}$ and $\tilde{I} = -71.41751^{\circ} \pm 0.00182^{\circ}$ and declinations $\hat{D} = -16.22821^{\circ} \pm 0.00050^{\circ}$ and $\tilde{D} = -23.39541^{\circ} \pm 0.01049^{\circ}$. The caret ($^{\wedge}$) and tilde ($^{\sim}$) denote the results computed by using, respectively, the least-squares and robust estimates.

For verifying the plausibility of the estimated inclinations and declinations, we used them to reduce the observed total-field anomaly (Fig. \ref{fig:TFA-Diorama}) to the pole. Figure \ref{fig:TFA-Diorama-RTP} shows that the estimated magnetization directions obtained with the least-squares and robust estimates lead to very confident RTP anomalies, since the dipolar characteristic of observed total-field anomaly (Fig. \ref{fig:TFA-Diorama}) is almost completely suppressed. We also used this estimated magnetization directions for reducing another total-field anomaly (Fig. \ref{fig:TFA-MCG}) to the pole. This total-field anomaly is located over the Montes Claros de Goiás alkaline complex (Fig. \ref{fig:geology-study-area}), which is near from the alkaline complex of Diorama. Fig. \ref{fig:TFA-MCG-RTP} shows that this estimated magnetization directions are very good because they yield predominantly positive RTP anomalies. These results show that the magnetization direction of the sources in the alkaline complex of Montes Claros de Goiás are very close to that ones estimated from the total-field anomaly (Fig. \ref{fig:TFA-Diorama}) near from the alkaline complex of Diorama, suggesting that these sources emplaced at depth within almost the same geological time interval.

\section{Conclusions}

We present a computationally effective method for estimating the magnetization direction of multiple sources with approximately spherical shapes by inverting the total-field anomaly produced by them. Our method assumes that the sources have uniform magnetization and that the positions of their centres are known. Prior knowledge about the source sizes is not required. Our method can be applied for interpreting multiple sources with different magnetization directions. Besides, it can be directly applied to interpret irregularly spaced total-field anomaly data measured on uneven surfaces and requires any prior transformation like reduction to the pole, total gradient or total magnitude anomalies. The method also contains flexibility to be implemented in two different numerical approaches. The first one is based on the minimization of the L2-norm of the residuals between the observed and predicted total-field anomalies. This approach results in a linear inverse problem for obtaining a least-squares estimate of the magnetization vector components of the sources. The second approach is based on the minimization of the L1-norm of the residuals between the observed and predicted total-field anomalies, leading to a non-linear inverse problem for obtaining a robust estimate of the magnetization vector components of the sources.

The results obtained with the synthetic data simulating a spherical source with known centre show the good performance of our method in retrieving the true magnetization direction. Tests with synthetic data produced by simulated sources that violates the premisses assumed by our method show the robustness of our method against interfering anomalies and against errors in the location of the centre of the source. The results show that our method is sensitive to errors in the horizontal location of the centre of the source, on the other hand, it is insensitive to errors in the depth of the centre of the source. Additionally, we show how the upward continuation can be used to make possible the application of our method for interpreting non-spherical sources producing total-field anomalies with non-dipolar features. These non-dipolar features can greatly affect the results obtained with the least-squares estimate, especially when the data are near from the source. Applications to field data over the Goiás Alkaline Province (GAP), Brazil, show that our method can be a powerful tool for interpreting real geological scenarios. Our estimates near from the alkaline complex of Diorama, suggest the presence of non-outcropping sources with strong remanent magnetization, corroborating previous works. This estimated magnetization direction leads to very plausible RTP anomalies not only over the region near from the complex of Diorama, but also over the alkaline complex of Montes Claros de Goiás. These results show that the non-outcropping sources near from the alkaline complex of Diorama have almost the same magnetization direction of that ones in the alkaline complex of Montes Claros de Goiás, strongly suggesting that these sources have emplaced at depth within almost the same geological time interval. 

Although the upward continuation seems to be useful for overcoming the difficulties in the interpretation of strongly non-dipolar total-field anomalies, there will always be a limit for using this technique. The interpreter should always verify the quality of the estimated magnetization direction by using, for example, a reduction to the pole. One might think that the high sensitivity of our method to uncertainties in the horizontal coordinates of the centres of the sources is a drawback. This is not true because these coordinates are generally well estimated by the Euler deconvolution. The high sensitivity of our method to errors in horizontal location of the centre of the sources suggests that  the horizontal coordinates of the sources’ centres could also be estimated by inversion. On the other hand, the insensitivity our method to errors in the depth of the sources suggests that the sources' depth could not be easily estimated by inversion and would need some a priori information.

\caption{Schematic representation of $L = 2$ spheres uniformly magnetized at the subsurface. These spheres have radii $R_{j}$ (dashed straight lines), constant magnetization vectors $\vec{m}^{j}$ and centres (grey dots) at $(xc_{j}, yc_{j}, zc_{j})$, $j = 1, ..., L$. The magnetic effect produced by these spheres can be observed at the points $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$, $i = 1, ..., N$ (black dots). In this Cartesian coordinate system, $x$ points to the geographic North, $y$ points to East and $z$ points downward.}

\caption{Robustness against non-spherical sources. (a) Rectangular prism with dimensions Lx, Ly and Lz and centre at the grey dot. (b) Projection of three prisms on the plane yz. All prisms have top at z = $10$ m and side lengths Lx = Lz = $1000$ m. The horizontal dimension Ly of each prism is equal to $200$ m, $1000$ m and $1800$ m. The dashed lines represent the vertical coordinate z of three different horizontal planes above the prisms. For convenience, all coordinates and lengths are normalized by the numerical value of Lz ($1000$ m) to obtain dimensionless quantities.}

Noise-corrupted total-field anomaly produced by each one of the three rectangular prisms shown in Fig. \ref{fig:robust-shape-methodology}b on three horizontal planes with different constant vertical coordinates z (dashed lines in Fig. \ref{fig:robust-shape-methodology}b). We consider that the centre of all prisms are located at $xc = 0.00$, $yc = 0.00$ and $zc = 0.51$.The intensity, declination and inclination of the magnetization vector of all prisms are equal to $6$ A/m, $-40^{\circ}$ and $30^{\circ}$, respectively. The simulated geomagnetic field is constant, with declination $-15^{\circ}$ and inclination $-10^{\circ}$. The data are in nT and all coordinates and lengths are dimensionless (see Fig. \ref{fig:robust-shape-methodology}).}

Each dot represents an estimated declination or inclination obtained from the total-field anomaly produced by a rectangular prism with a different Ly (Fig. \ref{fig:robust-shape-methodology}). z indicates the constant vertical coordinate of the planar surface on which the total-field anomaly was calculated (dashed lines in Fig. \ref{fig:robust-shape-methodology}b). The continuous black lines represent the true declinations and the true inclinations. The dashed lines represent the true declination or the true inclination $\pm 5^{\circ}$.}

The estimated declinations and inclinations were obtained by presuming different positions for the centre of the source along the x-, y- and z-axis. Along each axis, the magnetization direction was estimated by considering $21$ different centres regularly spaced in a range of $2000$ m on a line passing through the right coordinates of the centre of the simulated spherical body (vertical dashed lines). The continuous black lines represent the true declinations and the true inclinations. The horizontal dashed lines represent the true declination or the true inclination $\pm 5^{\circ}$.}
